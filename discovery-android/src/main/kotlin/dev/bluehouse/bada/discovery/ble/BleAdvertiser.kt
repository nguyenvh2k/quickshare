/**
 * Sender-side BLE advertiser that emits the Quick Share service-data pulse
 * (#32). Stock Quick Share / NearDrop receivers listen for this 24-byte
 * payload and, on seeing it, enable their mDNS responder so the sender's
 * Wi-Fi LAN discovery can find them.
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 *
 *  1. The caller (typically `SendActivity` after the share intent is
 *     parsed) constructs a [BleAdvertiser] for an application [Context].
 *  2. [start] returns a [BleAdvertiseHandle] when the platform accepts the
 *     advertisement, or `null` when the device cannot advertise (no
 *     adapter, no peripheral mode, Bluetooth off, missing
 *     `BLUETOOTH_ADVERTISE` permission, or the platform's
 *     [BluetoothLeAdvertiser.startAdvertising] callback reports failure).
 *  3. The handle's [close] stops the advertisement. Closing twice is a
 *     no-op; the advertiser may be re-`start`ed after close.
 *
 * The Quick Share advertisement is connectable to match stock sender
 * pulses. We still only need the receiver's BLE scan loop to wake up and
 * start its reachable bootstrap surface; connectability and the non-zero
 * `secret_id_hash` are classification signals for that active-send path.
 *
 * Threading: [start] / [close] are safe to call from any thread; the
 * underlying `BluetoothLeAdvertiser` callbacks fire on the main thread.
 *
 * Permissions:
 *  * API 31+ requires `BLUETOOTH_ADVERTISE` granted at runtime. Onboarding
 *    requests it (#31), but we still re-check on [start] because the user
 *    can revoke from Settings. A revoked permission yields `null` rather
 *    than a [SecurityException].
 *  * API 24–30 uses the legacy `BLUETOOTH` / `BLUETOOTH_ADMIN` model
 *    which is install-time and therefore always granted if declared.
