/**
 * Capability + permission probe for the Wi-Fi Direct medium (#49).
 *
 * Modeled as an interface so [WifiDirectMediumProvider] can be unit-
 * tested with a trivial fake without touching real Android system
 * services. The shipped implementation is [Default]; the provider's
 * public constructor wires it up against the application [Context].
 *
 * The four conditions [Default] gates on:
 *
 *  1. **Hardware feature flag.** Android exposes
 *     [PackageManager.FEATURE_WIFI_DIRECT] for chipsets / vendor builds
 *     that support P2P. Some low-tier OEM SKUs ship Wi-Fi without
 *     advertising the feature even though the API works; we honour the
 *     flag conservatively because [WifiP2pManager.initialize] silently
 *     no-ops on devices that do not have it, leading to `connect` calls
 *     that simply never callback.
 *  2. **System service present.** The platform returns `null` for
 *     `getSystemService(Context.WIFI_P2P_SERVICE)` in headless / TV
 *     profiles even when the feature flag is set. Pure defence-in-depth.
 *  3. **Runtime permission.** API 33+ requires
 *     [Manifest.permission.NEARBY_WIFI_DEVICES] to discover/connect over
 *     P2P; pre-33 falls back to [Manifest.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION].
 *     Onboarding (#31) requests `NEARBY_WIFI_DEVICES`; we re-check at
 *     every `isSupported` call because the user can revoke from Settings
 *     without restarting the app.
 *
 * Non-goals: [Default] does NOT verify that the device has *peer
 * mode* (peripheral vs. group-owner only); the platform reports both
 * modes as one feature flag. If a device only supports group-owner mode
 * we will discover that at `prepareUpgrade` / `adoptUpgrade` time and
 * fail back to the next ladder rung.
