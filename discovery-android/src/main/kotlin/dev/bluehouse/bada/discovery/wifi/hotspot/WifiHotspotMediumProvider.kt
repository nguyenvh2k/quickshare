/**
 * [MediumProvider] for [Medium.WIFI_HOTSPOT] (Wi-Fi local-only soft-AP).
 *
 * Wraps `WifiManager.startLocalOnlyHotspot` (sender side) and
 * `WifiNetworkSpecifier` + `ConnectivityManager.requestNetwork`
 * (receiver side). Because the Android entry-points are heavyweight
 * and asynchronous, the provider depends on two thin abstractions
 * defined alongside it — [HotspotController] and [HotspotClient] —
 * which production wires to the real platform classes and tests fake
 * with in-memory implementations.
 *
 * ### Server / client roles
 *
 * Quick Share's bandwidth-upgrade dance is symmetric on the medium
 * provider side: the **server role** prepares credentials
 * ([prepareUpgrade]); the **client role** adopts them ([adoptUpgrade]).
 * Mapping back to file-transfer semantics:
 *
 *  * The **receiver** (the side waiting for files) acts as the
 *    bandwidth-upgrade server. It owns the upgrade decision because
 *    it owns the channel selection.
 *  * The **sender** acts as the bandwidth-upgrade client.
 *
 * That orientation is intentional — the spec was designed so the
 * advertiser (receiver) can negotiate higher-bandwidth paths against
 * peers who are mid-transfer, without disrupting the original control
 * plane.
 *
 * ### Hotspot-specific orientation choice
 *
 * In **this** provider we **invert** the bandwidth-upgrade orientation
 * relative to receiver/sender so that the sender brings up the AP and
 * the receiver joins. This matches stock Quick Share behaviour and the
 * acceptance criteria on issue #50:
 *
 *  > Sender creates local-only hotspot, sends SSID + passphrase to
 *  > receiver via current transport, receiver joins.
 *
 * The provider exposes the asymmetry through the conventional
 * `prepareUpgrade` / `adoptUpgrade` shape so the framework code stays
 * generic, but the calling glue (Phase 4 #54 "orchestrator's upgrade
 * hook") is responsible for picking the right instance per role.
 *
 * ### Edge case: device already on a Wi-Fi network
 *
 * On most OEMs `WifiManager.startLocalOnlyHotspot` will tear down the
 * STA association before bringing the AP up; some Samsung / vivo
 * devices instead refuse to start the hotspot until the user manually
 * disconnects from Wi-Fi. The provider surfaces this as
 * `prepareUpgrade() == null` and the framework falls back to staying
 * on the current medium — see the manual interop checklist under
 * `docs/testing/interop-wifi-hotspot.md` for the matrix of OEM
 * behaviour.
 *
 * @param controller Lifecycle for the server-side hotspot. `null`
 *   marks this device as "cannot be the AP" — happens on emulators,
 *   form factors without Wi-Fi (Android TV without dongle), or when
 *   the runtime permission grant is missing.
 * @param client Lifecycle for the client-side join. `null` marks the
 *   device as "cannot join a soft-AP via WifiNetworkSpecifier" —
 *   pre-API-29 devices, devices where the manufacturer disabled
 *   `WifiNetworkSpecifier`, etc.
 * @param available Cheap O(1) capability probe ([isSupported]). Should
 *   reflect "device has Wi-Fi hardware AND the runtime permission
 *   grant we need is currently held". Defaults to `controller != null
 *   || client != null` — at least one role must be possible for the
 *   medium to be useful in the ladder.
