/**
 * Receiver-side BLE pulse advertiser for Quick Share (issue #121).
 *
 * The symmetric counterpart to [BleQuickShareScanner]. While the scanner
 * watches for **sender** pulses on service UUID `0xFE2C`, this class
 * advertises the **receiver's** identity on the canonical Quick Share
 * fast-advertisement service UUID `0xFEF3`
 * ([BleServiceData.SERVICE_UUID_128_STRING]). The two channels close the
 * loop: stock Quick Share peers cross-reference Wi-Fi LAN services they
 * discover against recently-seen BLE pulses on `0xFEF3`, and silently
 * drop mDNS-only peers from their picker. Without an advertiser on this
 * UUID, Bada is invisible to Galaxy / One UI's send sheet — that was
 * exactly the symptom commit c0150be diagnosed.
 *
 * ### Wire format
 *
 * The primary service-data payload is built as a compact BLE v2 GATT
 * advertisement header in `:core-protocol` (pure-JVM, KAT-tested). Stock
 * Samsung senders read the visible receiver identity from GATT slot zero,
 * where Bada publishes a standard GATT-slot advertisement:
 *
 * ```text
 * [ header | bloom_filter | advertisement_hash | psm=0 ]
 * ```
 *
 * Vivo/OriginOS devices can run Google Play services' own Nearby GATT
 * provider beside Bada. The regular `0xFEF3` slot service therefore
 * must stay published, and the primary advertisement header's slot hash must
 * match the same standard non-fast slot zero bytes that the GATT server
 * exposes. The connectable extended payload carries the visible receiver name
 * plus Nearby's RX instant-connection extra field so Samsung can resolve a
 * visible share-sheet row into Bada's GATT socket.
 *
 * Bada does not submit the optional DCT (`0xFC73`) advertisement in
 * receiver mode. Samsung ShareLive was observed to probe the DCT advertiser
 * address as if it were a GATT advertisement header after a successful first
 * transfer; that failed probe poisoned the next tap and routed it to GMS's
 * regular socket. The visible extended `0xFEF3` advertisement is the stable
 * identity surface for this path.
 *
 * ### Lifecycle
 *
 * Owned by [dev.bluehouse.bada.service.receiver.ReceiverForegroundService],
 * driven through the existing [dev.bluehouse.bada.service.receiver.MdnsAdvertisementGate].
 * The gate already decides when the receiver should be visible based on
 * BLE *scan* activity, the user's "always visible" override, and the QR
 * session flag; this advertiser's [start] / [stop] methods are wired off
 * the same publish/unpublish decisions so BLE and mDNS are advertised
 * (and unpublished) symmetrically.
 *
 * The class shape mirrors [BleQuickShareScanner]:
 *  * [start] is idempotent and non-suspending. Calling [start] while
 *    already advertising is a no-op.
 *  * [stop] is idempotent. Safe to call from any thread; safe to call
 *    inline from `Service.onDestroy`.
 *  * [setAdvertiseMode] switches between [AdvertiseSettings.ADVERTISE_MODE_BALANCED]
 *    (background) and [AdvertiseSettings.ADVERTISE_MODE_LOW_LATENCY]
 *    (foreground) — symmetric to the scanner's BALANCED ↔ LOW_LATENCY
 *    pattern from #35. Idempotent if the mode is unchanged.
 *
 * ### Failure modes
 *
 * Like [BleAdvertiser] (the sender-side pulse), [start] returns `false`
 * — and logs without throwing — when:
 *  * `BLUETOOTH_ADVERTISE` is not granted at runtime (API 31+).
 *  * The device has no BLE peripheral mode
 *    (`BluetoothAdapter.bluetoothLeAdvertiser` returns null).
 *  * The Bluetooth adapter is turned off.
 *  * The platform's `startAdvertising` callback reports failure.
 *
 * In every case the receiver continues in mDNS-only mode — the picker
 * ranking degrades, but transfers still work. This matches the issue's
 * acceptance criterion: "On devices without peripheral-mode support,
 * degrade gracefully to mDNS-only without crashing or spamming logs."
 *
 * ### Permissions
 *
 * On API 31+ the runtime [Manifest.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADVERTISE] is
 * required. The umbrella manifest in `:app` declares it; the onboarding
 * flow in `:app/.../onboarding` requests it as an optional permission.
 * Pre-API-31 devices fall back to the install-time legacy
 * `BLUETOOTH` / `BLUETOOTH_ADMIN` permissions also declared in the
 * umbrella manifest.
 *
 * ### Testability
 *
 * [BleAdvertiserGate] abstracts the platform `BluetoothLeAdvertiser` so
 * unit tests on a plain JVM can drive the lifecycle through a fake.
 * Tests that need to observe a mode change inject a recorder and assert
 * on the captured `setAdvertiseMode` calls — see
 * `BleQuickShareAdvertiserTest`.
 *
 * @param gate platform-advertiser abstraction; tests inject a fake.
 * @param permissionChecker checks `BLUETOOTH_ADVERTISE` at start time;
 *   defaults to a [ContextCompat]-backed implementation in production.
 * @param payloadFactory builds the compact advertisement header from the
 *   supplied [EndpointInfo] and the latest endpoint_id. Visible identity rides
 *   in the optional extended/DCT advertisements.
 * @param visiblePayloadFactory optionally builds an Android O+ extended
 *   `0xFEF3` payload carrying the visible [EndpointInfo]. This is the BLE-only
 *   path Samsung ShareLive was observed to promote into the share sheet when
 *   DCT was ignored.
 * @param dctPayloadFactory optionally builds the `0xFC73` DCT payload for
 *   Android O+ secondary advertising. DCT is the stock Nearby path that
 *   carries a short visible receiver name without overfilling the 27-byte
 *   `0xFEF3` fast-advertisement value.
