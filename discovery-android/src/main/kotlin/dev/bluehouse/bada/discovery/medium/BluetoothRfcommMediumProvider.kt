/**
 * Issue #51 — Bluetooth RFCOMM bandwidth-upgrade medium.
 *
 * Stands up an RFCOMM service on the **server** (receiver) side and
 * connects to it on the **client** (sender) side. Throughput is
 * 1–2 Mbps in practice (Bluetooth Classic 4.x ~1 Mbps, 5.x ~2 Mbps);
 * the value of this rung is universal availability — every Android
 * device with a working radio can RFCOMM, even when no Wi-Fi network
 * is in range.
 *
 * Pairing is **not** required: we use the *insecure* RFCOMM variants
 * (`listenUsingInsecureRfcommWithServiceRecord` and
 * `createInsecureRfcommSocketToServiceRecord`) because the application
 * payload is already encrypted by UKEY2 + SecureChannel. Demanding
 * RFCOMM-layer pairing would just trigger a redundant OS pairing prompt
 * without adding meaningful security on top of what UKEY2 already
 * provides; the acceptance criteria on issue #51 spell this out
 * explicitly.
 *
 * ### Why this lives in `:discovery-android`
 *
 * `:core-protocol` is JVM-pure (no `android.*` imports — guarded in
 * code review). The provider therefore can't live in the protocol
 * module: it touches `BluetoothAdapter`, `BluetoothServerSocket`,
 * `BluetoothSocket`, runtime permission checks, and feature flags —
 * all `android.*`. The framework consumes us through
 * [MediumProvider] / [UpgradePathCredentials] / [UpgradedTransport],
 * none of which leak Android types into `:core-protocol`.
 *
 * ### Threading
 *
 *  - [isSupported] is called on the framework's caller thread (often
 *    the orchestrator's coroutine dispatcher). Pure synchronous polling
 *    of `BluetoothAdapter.isEnabled()` and `PackageManager` — safe to
 *    call anywhere.
 *  - [prepareUpgrade] / [adoptUpgrade] are `suspend` and dispatch their
 *    blocking I/O onto [Dispatchers.IO] internally. Closing the
 *    returned [BluetoothRfcommTransport] is safe from any thread.
 *
 * ### Cancellation
 *
 * `BluetoothServerSocket.accept()` and `BluetoothSocket.connect()` are
 * blocking syscalls; coroutine cancellation does **not** unblock them
 * while parked. Callers that want to cancel a pending accept/connect
 * MUST close the socket from another thread first (the close-before-
 * cancel pattern documented in the project's CLAUDE.md). That's the
 * orchestrator's responsibility once #54 wires this provider in.
 *
 * @property context Application context. Held weakly by Android only
 *   transitively (we re-resolve `BluetoothManager` per call rather than
 *   caching the adapter, so a Bluetooth toggle off→on is picked up the
 *   next time the provider is exercised).
 * @property bluetooth IO indirection — substituted in unit tests so the
 *   per-call surface (`isAvailable`, `listen`, `connect`) is mockable
 *   without pulling Robolectric into the module.
 * @property serviceUuid Stable SDP service-record UUID used for both the
 *   receiver-side `listenUsingInsecureRfcommWithServiceRecord` and the
 *   sender-side `createInsecureRfcommSocketToServiceRecord`. Defaults to
 *   [DEFAULT_SERVICE_UUID]; tests and debug builds may override.
 * @property serviceName SDP service-record human-readable name. Defaults
 *   to [DEFAULT_SERVICE_NAME]; not load-bearing on the wire (the UUID
 *   is the actual lookup key) but Android requires a non-null string.
