/**
 * One Quick Share peer observed via mDNS browse.
 *
 * Carries the raw on-the-wire instance name (already URL-safe-base64-decoded
 * is exposed via [endpointId]), the network address tuple needed to open a
 * TCP connection back to the peer, and the parsed [EndpointInfo] payload
 * extracted from the TXT record's `n` value.
 *
 * This is a deliberately thin DTO — higher layers (Phase 1's pairing/UI
 * code) decide how to dedupe, render, and rank peers. We keep the
 * structural data here and stop at the "we saw this device" boundary.
 *
 * @property instanceName the URL-safe-base64-encoded service-instance name
 *   (i.e. the raw [javax.jmdns.ServiceInfo.getName] value, before the
 *   service-type suffix was stripped).
 * @property endpointId the 4-byte endpoint-ID slice decoded out of
 *   [instanceName]; `null` if the name didn't decode to the expected
 *   10-byte layout.
 * @property addresses every IP address JmDNS reported for this peer.
 *   Phase 1 uses the first non-loopback IPv4 entry; the full list is kept
 *   for diagnostic logging and future IPv6 support.
 * @property port TCP port the peer's Quick Share server is listening on.
 * @property endpointInfo the parsed Quick Share endpoint descriptor, or
 *   `null` if the TXT record was missing the `n` key, the value didn't
 *   URL-safe-base64-decode, or the bytes failed [EndpointInfo.parse].
