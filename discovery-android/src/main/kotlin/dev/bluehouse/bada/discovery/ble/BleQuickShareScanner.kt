/**
 * Quick Share BLE pulse scanner.
 *
 * The receiver side of Phase 2's BLE auto-discovery (epic #2). Quick
 * Share senders advertise a 16-byte BLE service-data payload under
 * service UUID `0xFE2C` whenever they have something to send (#32).
 * The first 14 bytes of that payload are pinned by PROTOCOL.md:
 *
 * ```
 * fc 12 8e 01 42 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
 * ```
 *
 * The trailing two bytes are random and ignored. The scanner uses
 * `ScanFilter` with a prefix + mask to push the comparison into the
 * platform — only matching advertisements ever cross the kernel/user
 * boundary, which keeps power consumption acceptable.
 *
 * ### Lifecycle
 *
 * The class is designed to be owned by [dev.bluehouse.bada.service.receiver.ReceiverForegroundService].
 * The service starts the scanner when it comes up and stops it when it
 * tears down. Callers observe the scanner state through:
 *
 *  * [pulses] — a hot [Flow] of every matching [ScanResult]. Suitable
 *    for diagnostic logging or future "saw a pulse from X" UI.
 *  * [activity] — a [StateFlow] of [ScanActivity] indicating whether a
 *    pulse was seen recently. Issue #34 (mDNS gating) consumes this to
 *    decide whether to publish the receiver's mDNS service.
 *
 * The "active" / "idle" transition is driven by a configurable
 * [inactivityTimeoutMillis] — by default 30 s after the last seen pulse
 * the scanner reports [ScanActivity.Idle]. The platform scanner itself
 * keeps running while [start] is in effect; only the activity flag flips
 * back to idle. A future optimization may stop the platform scan during
 * idle stretches to save battery, but the issue's acceptance criterion
 * ("Battery consumption acceptable: in `SCAN_MODE_BALANCED`, BLE scan is
 * ~10–20 mAh/day") makes the always-on simpler approach acceptable for
 * Phase 2.
 *
 * ### Scan-mode tuning (#35)
 *
 * The scan registration runs in [ScanSettings.SCAN_MODE_BALANCED] by
 * default — the documented "low-power, foreground-service-friendly"
 * mode that Android allows to run continuously without throttling. The
 * scanner exposes [setScanMode] so the owning foreground service can
 * temporarily upgrade to [ScanSettings.SCAN_MODE_LOW_LATENCY] while the
 * user has the app foregrounded (responsiveness matters more than power
 * during active interaction) and revert back to BALANCED when the app
 * returns to the background. `setReportDelay(0)` is pinned for both
 * modes — non-zero delay batches advertisements which is unsuitable for
 * a near-real-time interactive trigger.
 *
 * Switching the scan mode while a scan is in flight tears down the
 * platform registration and re-registers with the new settings. This is
 * the platform-recommended pattern (`BluetoothLeScanner.startScan` is
 * idempotent on the callback identity but takes its `ScanSettings`
 * snapshot at registration time) and is fast in practice — the kernel
 * just updates the in-flight scan parameters.
 *
 * ### Threading
 *
 * `start` and `stop` are safe to call from any thread; they serialize
 * through a [Mutex] internally. The platform [ScanCallback] fires on
 * the system's binder thread; we hop straight back into the supplied
 * [coroutineScope] so consumer callbacks never block the binder pool.
 *
 * ### Permissions
 *
 * On API 31+ the runtime [Manifest.permission.BLUETOOTH_SCAN] is
 * required (already requested during onboarding by #31). On API ≤ 30
 * the install-time [Manifest.permission.BLUETOOTH] +
 * [Manifest.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN] permissions are sufficient and
 * the umbrella manifest in `:app` declares them with `maxSdkVersion=30`.
 *
 * If the permission is missing, [start] logs a warning and becomes a
 * no-op — the scanner does not throw because the receiver service must
 * keep working in mDNS-only mode when BLE is unavailable.
 *
 * ### Testability
 *
 * [BleScannerGate] abstracts the platform `BluetoothLeScanner` so unit
 * tests on a plain JVM can drive the lifecycle through a fake. Tests
 * that need to observe the [activity] flow flip drive the inactivity
 * timer through `runTest`'s virtual scheduler — see
 * `BleQuickShareScannerTest`.
 *
 * @param coroutineScope scope that owns the inactivity-timeout
 *   coroutine. Cancelling the scope only stops the timer — call [stop]
 *   explicitly to release the platform scan registration.
 * @param gate platform-scanner abstraction; tests inject a fake.
 * @param permissionChecker checks `BLUETOOTH_SCAN` at start time;
 *   defaults to a [ContextCompat]-backed implementation.
 * @param inactivityTimeoutMillis time after the last seen pulse before
 *   [activity] flips back to [ScanActivity.Idle]. 30 s by default per
 *   the issue's acceptance criterion.
