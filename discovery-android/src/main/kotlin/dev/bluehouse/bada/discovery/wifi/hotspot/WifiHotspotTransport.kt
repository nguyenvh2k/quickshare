 * Concrete [UpgradedTransport] returned by [WifiHotspotMediumProvider].
 *
 * Carries the open TCP [Socket] that the framework's SecureChannel layer
 * will wrap once the upgrade swap (Phase 4 #54) is wired in. Holds a
 * back-reference to the per-association teardown callback so the
 * orchestrator can release the temporary Wi-Fi network when the transfer
 * finishes — the platform will tear the association down anyway when our
 * `ConnectivityManager.NetworkCallback` is unregistered, but releasing
 * deterministically lets us free the radio quickly.
 *
 * Lives in `:discovery-android` (not `:core-protocol`) because it owns
 * an `android.net.*` callback handle and a real `java.net.Socket` whose
 * route was bound to a specific [android.net.Network]; the framework
 * only needs the [Socket] and an opaque "drop this when done" hook.
