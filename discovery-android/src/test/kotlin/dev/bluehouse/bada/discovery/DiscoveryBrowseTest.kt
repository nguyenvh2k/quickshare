/**
 * Integration-style tests exercising [Discovery] against the in-memory
 * [FakeNsd]. These verify that the publish + browse paths line up
 * correctly: an `advertise` call surfaces a `Resolved` event on a
 * concurrently-collected `browse` flow, including the bit-exact binary
 * TXT round-trip.
 *
 * The same coverage was previously provided by JmDNS-loopback tests; the
 * fake here replaces them so the suite continues to run on every JVM.
