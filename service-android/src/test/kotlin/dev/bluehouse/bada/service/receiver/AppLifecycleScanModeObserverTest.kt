/**
 * JVM unit tests for [AppLifecycleScanModeObserver].
 *
 * The observer is the glue between `ProcessLifecycleOwner` and the BLE
 * scan-mode sink (#35). We deliberately do not stand up a real
 * `ProcessLifecycleOwner` — its singleton requires `androidx.startup`
 * initialization that is awkward to drive from a JVM test. Instead we
 * exercise the observer against a synthetic [LifecycleRegistry] /
 * [LifecycleOwner] pair, the exact two-class collaboration that
 * `ProcessLifecycleOwner` itself uses.
 *
 * Pinned behaviour:
 *  * `onStart` (app foregrounded)  → sink receives LOW_LATENCY.
 *  * `onStop`  (app backgrounded) → sink receives BALANCED.
 *  * Repeated foreground/background transitions translate
 *    one-for-one to scan-mode change requests, in order.
