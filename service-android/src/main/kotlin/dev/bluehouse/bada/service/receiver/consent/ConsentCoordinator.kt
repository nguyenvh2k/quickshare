/**
 * Bridges
 * [dev.bluehouse.bada.service.receiver.ReceiverSession] events to
 * the consent surface (notification or in-app modal, #151).
 *
 * ### Responsibilities
 *
 *  1. Subscribe to the session's `activeConnections` flow. Each new
 *     [InboundConnection] gets a fresh observation coroutine that
 *     watches its [InboundConnection.state] for the
 *     `WaitingForUserConsent` transition.
 *  2. On `WaitingForUserConsent`, register the connection in
 *     [ConsentRegistry] and pick the appropriate consent surface based
 *     on whether any Bada activity is currently foregrounded:
 *      * **Foreground** — ask the [Sink] to launch the in-app modal.
 *      * **Background** — ask the [Sink] to post the heads-up
 *        notification.
 *  3. On `ProcessLifecycleOwner` foreground/background transitions
 *     (#151), per still-pending entry: switch the surface so the modal
 *     follows the user from notification to in-app and back. Decided
 *     entries are *not* re-surfaced — the per-connection state machine
 *     guarantees `Decided` is terminal.
 *  4. On any terminal connection state — Receiving (the user already
 *     accepted), Rejected, Cancelled, Failed, Completed — unregister
 *     the entry and ask the [Sink] to dismiss whichever surface is
 *     currently up.
 *  5. On the session's `results` flow (which fires the final
 *     completion), idempotently dismiss in case the per-connection
 *     state observer was cancelled before reaching a terminal state.
 *
 * ### Per-connection-id surface state
 *
 * The coordinator tracks a small finite-state machine per pending
 * consent: `Notification`, `Modal`, or `Decided`. The transitions are:
 *
 * ```
 *   (none) --bg arrival--> Notification
 *   (none) --fg arrival--> Modal
 *   Notification --fg-->   Modal           (dismiss notification, launch modal)
 *   Modal --bg-->          Notification    (cancel modal, post notification)
 *   Notification --decided/terminal--> Decided
 *   Modal --decided/terminal--> Decided
 *   Decided --any--> Decided                (no-op: dismiss is already done)
 * ```
 *
 * `Decided` is a tombstone that prevents the foreground/background
 * watcher from re-raising a notification for a connection the user has
 * already responded to (issue #151 acceptance criterion: "a
 * notification for connection A must not be suppressed because the
 * user is foregrounded for an unrelated previous connection B that
 * has already been decided").
 *
 * ### Why a `Sink` interface
 *
 * The actual notification posting needs an Android `Context` and the
 * trampoline launch needs an [android.app.Activity] / [Class<*>] hop;
 * the coordinator's responsibility is purely the choreography. Pulling
 * the side-effects out behind [Sink] keeps the coordinator on plain
 * JVM and gives unit tests a clean assertion target.
 *
 * ### Lifecycle
 *
 * Constructed by the foreground service and started with [start];
 * stopped with [stop]. The coordinator launches its own coroutines
 * under the supplied [scope] but never owns the scope itself.
