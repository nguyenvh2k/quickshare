/**
 * Persistent store for the user's chosen "Save to" tree URI (issue #42).
 *
 * NearDrop's tracker has a recurring "save somewhere other than
 * Downloads" request (grishka/NearDrop#170). On Android the natural
 * primitive is `ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT_TREE` paired with
 * [ContentResolver.takePersistableUriPermission], which gives us a
 * tree URI that survives reboots. This class is the single source of
 * truth for that URI:
 *
 *  - **Persistence** uses the same lightweight [SharedPreferences]
 *    pattern as [dev.bluehouse.bada.service.downloads.SaveLocationPreferences]'
 *    sibling settings classes (e.g. battery-optimization preferences in
 *    `:app`). Pulling in `androidx.datastore` for one URI string would
 *    add Kotlin/coroutines weight that isn't justified yet; the API
 *    is narrow enough that a future migration is a one-class swap.
 *  - **Permission lifecycle** is centralised here so callers don't
 *    duplicate the `takePersistableUriPermission` /
 *    `releasePersistableUriPermission` pair. [setSaveTreeUri] grants;
 *    [clear] revokes.
 *  - **Validation** verifies the URI is still in our persisted-grant
 *    list before returning it. If the user revoked the grant via
 *    system Settings or wiped the source provider's data, the URI
 *    becomes useless and we fall back to Downloads instead of letting
 *    the receive path crash mid-transfer.
 *
 * The class is platform-agnostic at its public surface — it holds
 * onto a `Context` only to obtain the application-wide
 * `SharedPreferences` and `ContentResolver`. Tests exercise the
 * persistence + permission flow against an in-memory
 * [SharedPreferences] fake and a recording [UriPermissionGateway],
 * keeping the JVM unit test seam Robolectric-free.
