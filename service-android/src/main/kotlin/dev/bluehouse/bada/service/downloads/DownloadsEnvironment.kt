/**
 * Abstract platform surface the [DownloadsWriter] needs to open, commit,
 * and discard destination files.
 *
 * Two concrete implementations exist:
 *
 *  - [MediaStoreDownloadsEnvironment] — backed by Android's `MediaStore`
 *    + `ContentResolver`. Used on API 29+ where scoped storage forbids
 *    direct writes under `/sdcard/Download`.
 *  - [LegacyDownloadsEnvironment] — backed by
 *    `Environment.getExternalStoragePublicDirectory(DIRECTORY_DOWNLOADS)`.
 *    Used on API 24-28 where the legacy storage model still permits
 *    direct file writes (with `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`).
 *
 * The interface itself is platform-agnostic — it deals only in
 * [Destination] handles, [OutputStream]s, and `String` filenames — so
 * the bulk of the [DownloadsWriter] logic (filename collision, error
 * handling, sanitization wiring) can be unit-tested on a plain JVM with
 * a fake environment. Only the two real implementations need an Android
 * device or Robolectric to exercise.
 *
 * ### Lifecycle of a destination
 *
 *  1. [insertPending] reserves a destination slot (a `MediaStore` row
 *     marked `IS_PENDING=1`, or a placeholder file with `.part` suffix
 *     in the legacy case). Returns a [Destination] handle the caller
 *     uses to refer back to that slot.
 *  2. [openOutputStream] opens a writable stream over the slot's
 *     storage. The caller writes bytes and closes the stream; the
 *     environment does NOT wrap close-on-success commit logic — that
 *     is the [DownloadsWriter]'s job.
 *  3. Exactly one of [commit] or [discard] is called on the handle:
 *     - [commit] flips `IS_PENDING=0` (or renames `.part` → final name)
 *       so the file becomes visible to the user.
 *     - [discard] deletes the row / file. Used when the transfer fails
 *       partway through.
 *
 *  Implementations MUST be safe to call [discard] after [commit] (and
 *  vice versa) without throwing — duplicate disposal is a no-op.

     * `report (1).pdf`) but MUST NOT modify the body of the name.
     *
     * @param displayName Sanitized filename (no separators, no leading
     *   dots, never empty).
     * @param mimeType Best-effort MIME type. Implementations MAY pass
     *   it to `MediaStore.MediaColumns.MIME_TYPE`. `null` lets the
     *   platform infer it from the filename extension.
     * @param relativeSubPath Pre-sanitized list of subdirectory
     *   segments under the Downloads root (e.g.
     *   `["Trip Photos", "2025"]`). Empty means "write directly under
     *   Downloads/". Implementations are free to interpret this either
     *   as a `MediaStore.Downloads.RELATIVE_PATH` suffix or a nested
     *   filesystem subdirectory; the writer guarantees every segment
     *   is already filename-safe (no separators, no `..`, no control
     *   chars).
     * @return Opaque [Destination] handle. Subsequent calls to
     *   [openOutputStream], [commit], or [discard] take this handle.
     * @throws java.io.IOException if reservation fails (e.g. the
     *   `MediaStore` insert returns `null`, or the legacy directory is
     *   not writable).
