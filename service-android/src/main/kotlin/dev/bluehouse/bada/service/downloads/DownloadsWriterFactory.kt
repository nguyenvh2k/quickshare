/**
 * Public entry point for constructing a [MediaStoreDownloadsFactory]
 * configured for the device the app is currently running on.
 *
 * This is the **only** member callers outside this package need to
 * know about. The internal split into [DownloadsEnvironment] +
 * [DownloadsWriter] + [MediaStoreDownloadsFactory] is for testability
 * and structure; consumers (the receiver orchestrator in #21) just
 * call [create] and inject the returned factory into
 * [dev.bluehouse.bada.protocol.connection.InboundConnection.run].
 *
 * ### Environment selection
 *
 *  1. **User-chosen save tree (issue #42):** if [SaveLocationPreferences]
 *     reports a still-valid persisted SAF tree URI, files are written
 *     there via [SafTreeDownloadsEnvironment]. The user-picked tree
 *     trumps the device's default Downloads location regardless of
 *     API level.
 *  2. **API 29+ (Q and above):** falls back to
 *     [MediaStoreDownloadsEnvironment] writing under `Downloads/`.
 *     No `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission needed.
 *  3. **API 24-28:** falls back to [LegacyDownloadsEnvironment]
 *     writing to
 *     `Environment.getExternalStoragePublicDirectory(DIRECTORY_DOWNLOADS)`.
 *     The caller must already hold `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` (declared
 *     in `:service-android/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` with
 *     `maxSdkVersion="28"`).
 *
 * The branch is taken once per [create] call. Because the foreground
 * service constructs a fresh factory per accepted connection
 * (`factoryProvider = { DownloadsWriterFactory.create(context) }`),
 * a settings change between transfers picks up automatically without
 * any explicit invalidation.

     * device, honouring any user-chosen save location.

     *   [android.content.ContentResolver], the spool directory, and
