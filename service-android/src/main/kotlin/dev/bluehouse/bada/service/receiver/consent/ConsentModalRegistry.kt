/**
 * Process-wide registry of live consent-modal callbacks keyed by
 * connection id (#151).
 *
 * ### Why a registry
 *
 * The foreground-modal path needs the [ConsentCoordinator] (running on
 * a service-scope coroutine) to be able to dismiss the in-app trampoline
 * activity when the user backgrounds Bada — without auto-rejecting
 * the consent. The coordinator does not own an Activity reference, so
 * it talks to a "dismiss me" callback that the activity registers in
 * its `onCreate` and unregisters in `onDestroy`. The registry is the
 * indirection that lets the JVM-pure coordinator stay free of any
 * Android Activity import.
 *
 * Mirrors the shape of
 * [dev.bluehouse.bada.service.receiver.progress.TransferCancelRegistry]
 * — same lifetime contract, same threading guarantees — so the two
 * stay symmetric and easy to read together.
 *
 * ### Lifetime
 *
 * Entries live from the trampoline activity's `onCreate` through
 * `onDestroy`. The activity is responsible for unregistering on
 * destroy; if it forgets (e.g. process death), the entry leaks
 * harmlessly until the process exits. Idempotent.
 *
 * ### Thread-safety
 *
 * Backed by a [ConcurrentHashMap] — every entry-point is safe to call
 * from the coordinator coroutine, the activity's UI thread, or a
 * future test runner.
