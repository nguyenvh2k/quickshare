/**
 * Drives the in-flight transfer progress notification surface (#46).
 *
 * Mirrors the shape of
 * [dev.bluehouse.bada.service.receiver.consent.ConsentCoordinator]
 * — subscribe to the receiver session's `activeConnections` flow,
 * spawn a per-connection observation coroutine that watches
 * [InboundConnection.state] for the `Receiving` transition, and
 * surface that as side-effects through a [Sink].
 *
 * ### Throttling
 *
 * The receiver-side payload pipeline can produce a `Receiving`
 * StateFlow update on every 512 KiB chunk — at LAN speeds that fires
 * faster than NotificationManager can render. The coordinator
 * coalesces updates by holding the most recent state and re-posting
 * the notification at most every [POST_INTERVAL_MILLIS] ms (issue
 * #46 acceptance: "updates every ~500 ms"). Terminal transitions
 * (Completed / Failed / Cancelled / Rejected) bypass the throttle so
 * the dismiss path runs immediately.
 *
 * ### Why a `Sink` interface
 *
 * Same rationale as the consent coordinator: the actual notification
 * post / dismiss / cancel-registration calls need an Android
 * `Context`; the coordinator's responsibility is the choreography
 * (when to post vs when to dismiss, what message to render). Pulling
 * the side-effects out behind [Sink] keeps the coordinator on plain
 * JVM and gives unit tests a clean assertion target.
 *
 * ### Lifecycle
 *
 * Constructed by the foreground service and started with [start];
 * stopped with [stop]. The coordinator launches its own coroutines
 * under the supplied [scope] but never owns the scope itself.
