/**
 * Process-wide "is any Bada activity foregrounded right now" flag.
 *
 * The interface is intentionally small so unit tests can drive it
 * without standing up `androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-process` /
 * Robolectric — the production wiring uses
 * [ProcessLifecycleOwnerAppForegroundState] which adapts
 * [ProcessLifecycleOwner] to this surface, while tests construct an
 * [InMemoryAppForegroundState] and toggle the value directly.
 *
 * ### Why "any Bada activity"
 *
 * The foreground-consent-modal flow (#151) has to work regardless of
 * which Bada activity is on top — `MainActivity` while the user is
 * browsing settings, `SendActivity` while a sender flow is in progress,
 * `ShowQrActivity` while a QR pairing screen is up, or the consent
 * trampoline itself. [ProcessLifecycleOwner] aggregates every activity
 * in the process into a single STARTED+ vs CREATED state that flips
 * exactly when the user backgrounds or foregrounds the whole app, which
 * is the truth source we want.
 *
 * ### Listener semantics
 *
 * Listeners are invoked exactly once per actual transition (background
 * to foreground or vice versa). Equal-state re-emissions are coalesced
 * by the implementation so a listener never sees `true -> true` or
 * `false -> false`. This matches the way `ProcessLifecycleOwner`
 * already behaves and keeps the per-connection-id surface routing in
 * [dev.bluehouse.bada.service.receiver.consent.ConsentCoordinator]
 * idempotent.
 *
 * ### Threading
 *
 * Implementations must be safe to call from any thread. The production
 * adapter delivers callbacks on the main thread (per
 * [ProcessLifecycleOwner]'s contract); the in-memory test
 * implementation invokes listeners on whichever thread called
 * [InMemoryAppForegroundState.set].
