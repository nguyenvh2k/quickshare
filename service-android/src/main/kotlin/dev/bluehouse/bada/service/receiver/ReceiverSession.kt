/**
 * Pure-JVM coordinator for a single receiver lifecycle. Wires together:
 *
 *  1. A [TcpReceiverServer] (#19) — bound on an ephemeral port, accepts
 *     inbound Quick Share connections, runs each through
 *     [dev.bluehouse.bada.protocol.connection.InboundConnection].
 *  2. An mDNS publisher (#18) — abstracted by [DiscoveryAdvertiser] so
 *     unit tests don't need to stand up real `Discovery` against
 *     loopback.
 *  3. A per-connection [FileDestinationFactory] provider — the
 *     `MediaStoreDownloadsFactory` (#23) holds per-transfer state, so the
 *     server is given a `() -> FileDestinationFactory` rather than one
 *     shared instance.
 *
 * Phase 1 also held a [WifiManager.MulticastLock] across the receiver
 * lifecycle so the Wi-Fi chip would not drop inbound multicast while
 * the screen was off. After the #98 migration to `NsdManager`, the
 * system mDNS responder process owns the multicast filter exemption and
 * the in-app multicast lock is no longer needed — the parameter and
 * the related lifecycle calls were removed from this class.
 *
 * ### Why this is a pure-JVM class
 *
 * The Android `Service` (`ReceiverForegroundService`) holds nothing but
 * plumbing: the notification surface, the foreground-state transitions,
 * and the binders into Android lifecycle callbacks. Every piece of
 * actual coordination — start order, teardown order, idempotency,
 * forwarding completions onto a public `Flow` — lives here so it can be
 * exercised on a plain JVM with no Robolectric or instrumentation
 * harness.
 *
 * ### Lifecycle contract
 *
 *  - [start] is one-shot. It binds the listener, registers the mDNS
 *    advertisement against the bound port, and forwards completions
 *    onto [completions]. Any failure during setup rolls back the
 *    partially-acquired resources before throwing.
 *  - [stop] is idempotent and may be called from any thread. It tears
 *    everything down in reverse order: close the advertise handle, stop
 *    the TCP server, cancel the internal coroutine scope.
 *  - [completions] re-emits every [InboundConnectionCompletion] from the
 *    underlying server. Higher layers (the consent UI in #22, transfer
 *    history) collect this; for now the foreground service forwards it
 *    via a `LocalBroadcastManager`-style hook.
 *
 * ### Concurrency
 *
 * Setup and teardown serialize on a per-instance lock so a racing
 * `stop()` cannot observe a half-built session. Once running, the only
 * work this class does is forward [TcpReceiverServer.results] onto
 * [completions]; that runs in [scope] under a [SupervisorJob] so a
 * single buggy collector cannot poison the rest of the receiver.
 *
 * @property tcpServerFactory Builds the TCP server given the parent
 *   scope and per-connection factory provider. Production wires a
 *   default `TcpReceiverServer`; tests inject a fake.
 * @property advertiser Publishes the receiver via mDNS and returns an
 *   [AdvertiseHandle]. Production wires `Discovery::advertise`; tests
 *   inject a recording fake.
 * @property factoryProvider Per-connection [FileDestinationFactory]
 *   factory. Production wires `DownloadsWriterFactory.create(context)`
 *   (which yields a fresh `MediaStoreDownloadsFactory` each time); tests
 *   inject a no-op or in-memory provider.
 * @property endpointInfo The receiver's identity. The caller seeds it on
 *   construction and may replace it later via [replaceEndpointInfo] so the
 *   advertised device name can change without tearing down the TCP listener or
 *   aborting in-flight receives. Embedded in the mDNS TXT record so peers can
 *   render the device name and salt+key without a separate request.
 * @property secureRandomProvider Supplies a fresh [SecureRandom] per
 *   accepted connection (UKEY2 keypairs / SecureMessage IVs). Tests
 *   inject a deterministic stub.
 * @property advertiseGated When `true`, [start] binds the TCP listener
 *   but does **not** publish the mDNS advertisement. The caller is
 *   then responsible for calling [publishAdvertisement] /
 *   [unpublishAdvertisement] to drive the advertise lifecycle
 *   externally. Used by [MdnsAdvertisementGate] (#34) to bind publish
 *   to BLE pulse activity. Defaults to `false` for
 *   backward-compatibility — `start()` publishes immediately as in
 *   Phase 1.
 * @property initialControlServers Optional non-LAN initial-control
 *   advertisement/listener surfaces. These are published and
 *   unpublished with the same visibility lifecycle as mDNS.
