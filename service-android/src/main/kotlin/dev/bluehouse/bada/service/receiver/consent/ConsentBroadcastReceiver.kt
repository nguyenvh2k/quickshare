/**
 * Broadcast receiver that translates an Accept / Reject notification
 * action into a call to
 * [dev.bluehouse.bada.protocol.connection.InboundConnection.submitUserConsent].
 *
 * ### Why a `BroadcastReceiver`
 *
 * The consent action must work even when the screen is off and the
 * launcher has killed the app's activities. `Notification.Action`s
 * with `PendingIntent.getBroadcast(...)` are the documented Android
 * way to deliver the user's input straight to a process-resident
 * receiver without going through the activity stack: the system
 * holds the foreground service alive long enough for the receiver to
 * run.
 *
 * ### Lifecycle
 *
 * Android instantiates this class fresh every time it delivers an
 * intent — `onReceive` runs on the main thread and must finish in
 * under 10 seconds (we finish in microseconds). Because the receiver
 * has no constructor injection point, it consults
 * [ConsentRegistry.instance] for the live connection. The foreground
 * service is responsible for keeping the registry populated.
 *
 * The actual `submitUserConsent` call is non-blocking — the
 * [dev.bluehouse.bada.protocol.connection.InboundConnection]
 * implementation queues consent into an in-memory channel and returns
 * immediately, so we never need a `goAsync()`.
 *
 * ### Routing
 *
 * Routing is delegated to the pure-JVM
 * [ConsentRouter] so the wire-decoding logic can be unit-tested
 * without Robolectric. This class is the thin Android-side adapter:
 * grab the intent, hand it to the router, fire any side-effects the
 * router asks for, return.
