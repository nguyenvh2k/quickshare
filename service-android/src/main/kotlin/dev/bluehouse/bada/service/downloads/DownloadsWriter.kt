/**
 * Glue that turns a peer-supplied filename into a writable destination
 * inside the user's Downloads directory.
 *
 * `DownloadsWriter` is **platform-agnostic**: it operates entirely in
 * terms of a [DownloadsEnvironment], which abstracts away the
 * `MediaStore` API on API 29+ from the legacy
 * `Environment.getExternalStoragePublicDirectory` API on API 24-28.
 * That abstraction lets us unit-test all of the writer's behavior —
 * filename sanitization, collision suffixing, success/failure
 * lifecycle — on a plain JVM, against a [DownloadsEnvironment] fake.
 *
 * Production wiring is in [DownloadsWriterFactory.create], which
 * picks the right [DownloadsEnvironment] for the current API level
 * before constructing this writer.
 *
 * ### Lifecycle of one received file
 *
 * ```
 * val handle = writer.beginWrite(rawFileName, mimeType)
 * try {
 *     handle.outputStream.use { stream -> /* write payload bytes */ }
 *     handle.commit()        // marks IS_PENDING=0 / renames .part
 * } catch (e: Throwable) {
 *     handle.discard()       // deletes the row / file
 *     throw e
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The `commit` / `discard` split is deliberate: the [PayloadAssembler]
 * (in `:core-protocol`) closes the destination [java.nio.channels.WritableByteChannel]
 * BEFORE the surrounding orchestrator (#21) knows whether the transfer
 * succeeded. Closing alone cannot decide commit-vs-discard; the
 * orchestrator drives that explicitly via the handle.
 *
 * @property environment Abstract storage backend.
 * @property fallbackName Replacement string when a peer-supplied
 *   filename sanitizes to empty (e.g. `"."` or `""`). Defaults to
 *   [FilenameSanitizer.DEFAULT_FALLBACK].
 * @property maxCollisionAttempts Upper bound on the suffix counter when
 *   the chosen filename collides with an existing entry. Quick Share
 *   never realistically pushes more than a handful of files with the
 *   same name, so 1024 is generous; failing here is preferable to
 *   spinning forever if a misbehaving environment never converges.
