/**
 * ShareRadioController — the ONE place that forces Wi-Fi + Bluetooth on for a
 * share and restores them after, on behalf of every share entry point.
 *
 * ### Why this exists
 *
 * Three flows need the radios on for a transfer: the SENDER
 * ([dev.bluehouse.bada.send.SendActivity]), the cold NFC tap-to-receive wake, and
 * the Quick Settings tile (both via
 * [dev.bluehouse.bada.service.receiver.ReceiverForegroundService]). Each used to
 * re-implement the identical dance — create a [RadioHelperClient], `connect`,
 * `prepareForShare(RADIO_BOTH)`, track a "prepared" flag, then on teardown
 * `transferFinished` + `disconnect`. This class holds that logic once so the
 * call sites just say [requestRadiosOn] at share start and [restoreRadios] at
 * the terminal.
 *
 * The actual capture-original / enable-only-off / restore-only-ours logic lives
 * in the `:radio-helper` app's SESSION mode (the helper owns it and persists it
 * across a process kill); this controller is only the client-side lease.
 *
 * ### Contract / behaviour (preserved verbatim from the old call sites)
 *
 *  - [requestRadiosOn] is best-effort and async (binds on the caller's thread,
 *    work happens on the helper's): if the helper isn't installed / has the
 *    wrong signing key / is force-stopped / times out, the radios are left
 *    as-is and the caller's own fallback applies. No ANR.
 *  - [restoreRadios] tells the helper the share is over so it restores ONLY the
 *    radios it turned on, then unbinds. `finishSession` lets a caller unbind
 *    WITHOUT ending the helper session — the sender uses this on a
 *    config-change recreate (`isFinishing == false`): drop this dead instance's
 *    binding but leave the persisted, re-entrant helper session for the
 *    recreated instance to re-prepare. The receiver always ends the session.
 *  - [logTag] is the logcat tag for observability; pass `null` for none.
 *
 * Holds at most one client at a time; not thread-safe — call from a single
 * thread per instance (the main thread, as both existing call sites do).
