/**
 * Append-only diagnostic logger for the receiver-side consent surface
 * lifecycle (issue #151 / PR #152 follow-up).
 *
 * Writes timestamped lines to
 * `getExternalFilesDir(null)/bada-inbound.log`, the same file the
 * inbound-state diagnostic logger already uses, so a single
 * `adb shell cat` pulls the complete picture across the protocol layer
 * and the consent surface. The shared file matters on Funtouch /
 * OriginOS where logcat silently drops `Log.i` / `Log.w` lines from
 * apps that have not been hand-blessed by the vendor — `Log.e` plus
 * the on-disk fallback are the only reliable diagnostic channels.
 *
 * Lines look like:
 *
 * ```text
 * 1777870576772 consent: raise id=200181303 isForeground=true target=Modal
 * 1777870576773 consent: trampoline.onCreate id=200181303 lookup=present
 * 1777870576774 consent: trampoline.bindIntent.finish id=200181303 reason=lookup-null
 * ```
 *
 * The prefix `consent:` is intentional — `appendInboundLog` already
 * uses the file without a prefix, so a `grep '^[0-9]\+ consent:'`
 * isolates the consent-surface trace.
 *
 * The class is deliberately a `Context`-coupled object rather than a
 * static singleton because the writer needs a real `Context` to
 * resolve `getExternalFilesDir(null)`. The cost of plumbing the
 * `Context` through the few call sites is preferable to the
 * leak-prone alternative of holding an application reference in a
 * `companion object`.

     * `public` rather than `internal` because [ConsentTrampolineActivity]
     * lives in the `:app` module (Kotlin `internal` is per-module).
     * The exposed surface is a single best-effort write — nothing
     * load-bearing leaks across the boundary.
