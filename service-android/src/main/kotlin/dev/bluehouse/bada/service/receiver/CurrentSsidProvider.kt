/**
 * Look up the device's current Wi-Fi SSID for display in the
 * receiver's persistent foreground notification (#85).
 *
 * ### Why this lives in its own object
 *
 * The notification body builder is heavily exercised by unit tests; the
 * Wi-Fi system service is not unit-testable on a plain JVM. Splitting
 * the lookup off behind [CurrentSsidProvider] (which the notification
 * builder consumes via the platform-agnostic [stripSsidQuotes] helper)
 * keeps the SSID-stripping logic JVM-testable while letting the
 * Android-only [readCurrentSsid] step stay isolated.
 *
 * ### Caveats called out in the issue body
 *
 *  - Android wraps the SSID it returns from `WifiManager.connectionInfo`
 *    in surrounding double quotes. We strip those before display.
 *  - On API 31+ `WifiManager.getConnectionInfo()` is deprecated and may
 *    return the literal string `<unknown ssid>` for apps without
 *    precise location permission. We do **not** request a new permission
 *    for this nice-to-have surface — callers are expected to handle the
 *    unknown case gracefully (the notification falls back to a generic
 *    "Receiving on this network" string).
 *  - Any exception from the system service (rare, but observed on some
 *    OEM builds) is treated as "unknown".
