/**
 * Intent action / extra constants and pure-JVM intent-routing helpers
 * shared between the consent notification builder, the broadcast
 * receiver, and the trampoline activity.
 *
 * ### Why a separate object
 *
 * The constants need to be visible from three places in two modules:
 *
 *  - the notification builder in `:service-android` that constructs the
 *    `PendingIntent`s,
 *  - the broadcast receiver in `:service-android` that dispatches them,
 *  - the trampoline activity in `:app` that re-uses the same routing
 *    semantics for its in-app Accept / Reject buttons.
 *
 * Centralising avoids the classic Android footgun where one site
 * changes an action string and the other half of the rendezvous
 * silently breaks.
 *
 * ### Routing model
 *
 * Every consent broadcast carries:
 *
 *  - `ACTION_ACCEPT` or `ACTION_REJECT` — what the user pressed,
 *  - `EXTRA_CONNECTION_ID` (long) — which in-flight transfer the
 *    decision applies to (matches
 *    [dev.bluehouse.bada.protocol.server.InboundConnectionCompletion.connectionId]).
 *
 * The action distinguishes Accept vs Reject rather than a boolean
 * extra so a stale `PendingIntent` can be filterMatch-rejected by the
 * receiver before the extras are parsed.
 *
 * ### Pure-JVM extraction
 *
 * Tests assert routing semantics without touching real Android extras
 * by going through the pure-JVM extractor: a test constructs a fake
 * intent (just enough surface — see [parsePayload]) and verifies that
 * `parsePayload` either returns a [Payload] or `null`.
