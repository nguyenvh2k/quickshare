/**
 * Process-wide registry of in-flight [InboundConnection]s parked at
 * `WaitingForUserConsent`.
 *
 * ### Why a registry
 *
 * The consent UI fires its accept / reject decision through a
 * [android.app.PendingIntent] -> [android.content.BroadcastReceiver] hop
 * (so the action survives the screen being off and the app being killed
 * by the launcher). The receiver therefore cannot hold a direct
 * reference to the [InboundConnection] — `PendingIntent` extras must be
 * `Parcelable`, and the coroutine-bearing connection is decidedly not.
 * Instead, the broadcast carries a numeric **connection id** that is
 * looked up here to obtain the live [InboundConnection] to call
 * `submitUserConsent` on.
 *
 * The registry is keyed by the same `connectionId` that
 * [dev.bluehouse.bada.protocol.server.InboundConnectionCompletion]
 * surfaces, so log correlation (notification + receiver-server log line)
 * stays trivial.
 *
 * ### Lifetime
 *
 * Entries live from the moment the receiver session emits a connection
 * with state `WaitingForUserConsent` until the connection terminates
 * (Receiving, Rejected, Cancelled, Failed, or Completed). The registrar
 * is responsible for cleaning up via [unregister]; if the foreground
 * service is killed mid-flight, the process is gone too and the
 * registry contents go with it.
 *
 * ### Thread-safety
 *
 * Backed by a [ConcurrentHashMap] — every entry-point is safe to call
 * from the broadcast receiver's main thread, the foreground service's
 * coroutine, or the trampoline activity's UI thread. Operations are
 * O(1) and lock-free for typical sizes (at most a handful of pending
 * consents at once).

    /**
     * One pending consent. Pairs the [InboundConnection] (the API the
     * receiver eventually invokes `submitUserConsent` on) with a
     * point-in-time snapshot of the metadata the UI needs.
     *
     * The metadata is captured eagerly so a consent broadcast that fires
     * after the FSM has already started receiving (a rare race where
     * the user taps Accept just as the FSM moved past
     * WaitingForUserConsent) still has the original prompt context for
     * logging.
     *
     * @property submitConsent The decision sink. Production wires this
     *   to [InboundConnection.submitUserConsent]; tests inject a
     *   recording lambda so they can assert on the boolean without
     *   subclassing the (final) `InboundConnection` class. Default is
     *   `connection::submitUserConsent` so callers normally don't
     *   specify it.
