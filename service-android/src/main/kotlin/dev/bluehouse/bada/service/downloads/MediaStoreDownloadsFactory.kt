/**
 * `FileDestinationFactory` implementation that streams inbound FILE
 * payloads into the user's Downloads directory.
 *
 * On API 29+ the bytes flow through `MediaStore.Downloads` and end up
 * as a row visible in the system Downloads UI. On API 24-28 they flow
 * into `Environment.getExternalStoragePublicDirectory(DIRECTORY_DOWNLOADS)`.
 * The split is hidden behind a [DownloadsEnvironment]; the public API
 * here works the same on both.
 *
 * ### Why a spool file
 *
 * `:core-protocol`'s [PayloadAssembler] expects a [SeekableByteChannel]
 * destination (#44 — out-of-order FILE chunk delivery requires
 * `position(offset)` + write semantics). Neither `MediaStore`'s
 * `ContentResolver.openOutputStream` nor a plain `FileOutputStream`
 * gives us seekable writes through their `OutputStream` surface, so we
 * spool every in-flight payload to a private-storage `RandomAccessFile`
 * first. The spool's `FileChannel` is fully seekable, satisfying the
 * assembler's contract.
 *
 * On a successful [commit] we copy the spool bytes into the
 * `DownloadsEnvironment` destination's output stream and publish the
 * row. On [abort] we delete the spool and discard the destination.
 *
 * The spool also makes the future resume work in #43 considerably
 * simpler: the partial bytes are already on disk in their final byte
 * positions, so a reconnect can resume by re-opening the spool file
 * and seeking to the next un-covered offset.
 *
 * ### Why a stateful factory
 *
 * The [PayloadAssembler] in `:core-protocol` calls `close()` on the
 * returned [SeekableByteChannel] on BOTH the success path (LAST_CHUNK
 * arrived, byte count matches) and the failure path (a malformed
 * mid-stream chunk). `close()` alone cannot tell which case it is —
 * but committing a partial file to the Downloads UI is harmful (the
 * user sees a broken-looking file with a tickbox checkmark).
 *
 * To resolve this without changing the `:core-protocol` interface,
 * `MediaStoreDownloadsFactory` keeps a per-payload-id table of
 * [InFlight] entries. The wrapping orchestrator (#21):
 *
 *  1. Calls [open] when the assembler asks for a destination.
 *  2. On `PayloadEvent.FileComplete` from the assembler, calls
 *     [commit] with that payload id.
 *  3. On any error / cancel / unexpected channel close before
 *     LAST_CHUNK, calls [abort] with that payload id.
 *
 * Either [commit] or [abort] also closes the underlying channel and
 * the spool file if the assembler hadn't already, and removes the
 * entry from the in-flight map. Both are idempotent so a double-call
 * (e.g. abort during teardown after a commit during normal completion)
 * is a no-op.
 *
 * ### Thread safety
 *
 * The in-flight handle map is a [ConcurrentHashMap] so that a UI-side
 * cancel (which calls [abort] from a different coroutine than the
 * receive loop) does not race with [open] from the receive loop. The
 * [DownloadsWriter] and [DownloadsEnvironment] beneath are NOT
 * required to be thread-safe — the per-handle operations always run
 * on a single thread because each payload id is touched by exactly
 * one of `open` / `commit` / `abort` at a time.
 *
 * @param writer Allocator of new destinations. In production this is
 *   constructed via [DownloadsWriterFactory.create]. Tests pass a
 *   writer wrapping a fake [DownloadsEnvironment] so the routing logic
 *   is exercised on a plain JVM.
 * @param spoolDirectory Directory to use for per-payload spool files.
 *   In production this is the app's `cacheDir`. Tests inject a
 *   `@TempDir`. The directory is created lazily on the first [open]
 *   call.
