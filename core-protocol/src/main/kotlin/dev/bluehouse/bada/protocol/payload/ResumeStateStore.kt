/**
 * Persistent store of how far each in-flight FILE payload has gotten,
 * keyed by `(endpointId, payloadId)`.
 *
 * The receiver-side resume protocol (#43) needs to remember, across
 * connection lifetimes, which byte ranges of which payloads have
 * already been written to disk. When the same peer reconnects, the
 * receiver consults the store to:
 *
 *  1. Tell the [PayloadAssembler] to seed pre-existing coverage so
 *     duplicate chunks (the sender retransmits from offset 0) are
 *     deduplicated against on-disk bytes rather than re-written.
 *  2. Build the `AUTO_RESUME` frame announcing where to pick up.
 *
 * #### Identity model
 *
 * `endpointId` is the peer's wire-level endpoint identifier — the
 * 4-character string from the `ConnectionRequest` frame, persisted
 * across reconnects by the discovery layer. It is NOT the user-facing
 * device name (which can change). Pairing on this id keeps the resume
 * window correctly scoped: a different peer that happens to claim a
 * payload id we have seen does not get to inherit our partial file.
 *
 * `payloadId` is the `PayloadHeader.id` from the original session.
 * The sender is required to use the same id on resume; this is the
 * AUTO_RESUME contract. If the sender re-announces the same logical
 * file with a fresh id, we cannot match — the bytes start over.
 *
 * #### Threading
 *
 * Implementations MUST be thread-safe. The [PayloadAssembler]'s
 * receive loop calls [recordCoverage] from a single coroutine, but
 * [loadCoverage] / [purgeOlderThan] / [forget] may be called from a
 * UI coroutine or from the foreground service's GC tick. A
 * [java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap] or a `synchronized` block
 * is sufficient — all access patterns are short.
 *
 * #### Serialization
 *
 * Each [ResumeRecord] is value-typed and trivially serializable
 * (string + long + ranges of long pairs). The Android-side store can
 * persist as JSON in the app's `cacheDir`; the JVM-only test fake
 * keeps a `ConcurrentHashMap`. No Room schema migration is needed.
 *
