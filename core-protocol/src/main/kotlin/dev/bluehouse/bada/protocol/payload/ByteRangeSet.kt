/**
 * Mutable, ordered set of half-open byte ranges `[start, end)` over a
 * single payload.
 *
 * Used by [PayloadAssembler] to track which byte ranges of an inbound
 * FILE payload have already been written. Quick Share's wire spec
 * permits chunks to arrive in any order — sequential delivery is a
 * property of TCP, not of the application protocol — and #44 relaxes
 * the assembler's strict in-order check so the receiver can survive
 * mediums (Wi-Fi Direct, BLE L2CAP) that do not preserve order at the
 * application layer.
 *
 * ### Invariants
 *
 *  - All ranges are stored in a sorted, **non-overlapping**, **non-
 *    adjacent** form. After any successful [add], the set's internal
 *    list contains ranges with the property that `ranges[i].end <
 *    ranges[i+1].start` (strictly less, never equal — adjacent ranges
 *    are merged on insert).
 *  - Range bounds are non-negative; the empty range `[start, start)` is
 *    a no-op (silently ignored).
 *
 * ### Performance
 *
 *  - [add] is `O(log n + k)` where `n` is the number of stored ranges
 *    and `k` is the number of existing ranges that the new range
 *    overlaps or touches. In the common case (sequential arrival) `k`
 *    is constant — the new range merges with the tail and `n` stays
 *    at 1.
 *  - [contains] is `O(log n)` via binary search.
 *  - [coveredBytes] is `O(n)` and is invoked only at completion-check
 *    time, not on every chunk.
 *
 * ### Why a custom container instead of `RangeSet` / `IntervalTree`
 *
 * Pulling Guava just for `RangeSet` would balloon `:core-protocol`'s
 * dependency surface (Guava + its transitive `error_prone_annotations`
 * etc.) for the sake of one container that handles fewer cases than
 * we need anyway (Guava's `RangeSet` distinguishes open / closed
 * endpoints; we only ever use half-open `[start, end)`). A few dozen
 * lines of straight Kotlin keep the JVM-only build self-contained.
 *
 * Internal-ish API: not part of the documented `:core-protocol` public
 * surface, but `public` so the JVM tests can verify it. Marked
 * explicitly to keep `explicitApi()` happy.
