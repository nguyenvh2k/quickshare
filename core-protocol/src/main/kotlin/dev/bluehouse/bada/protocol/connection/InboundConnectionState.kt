/**
 * Observable lifecycle state of a single [InboundConnection] attempt.
 *
 * Surfaced via `InboundConnection.state` (a `StateFlow`) so the UI can
 * render a consent sheet, progress bar, success / failure toast, etc.
 * without polling the orchestrator.
 *
 * The states form a linear progression through the receiver-role wire
 * protocol, with [Failed] / [Cancelled] / [Rejected] / [Completed] as
 * terminal endpoints. The orchestrator does not transition out of a
 * terminal state — observers can rely on a single notification per
 * outcome.
 *
 * Transition graph (`->` is a state transition):
 *
 * ```
 *   Idle
 *     -> Handshaking                    (run() begins)
 *   Handshaking
 *     -> Negotiating                    (UKEY2 + connection-response done)
 *   Negotiating
 *     -> WaitingForUserConsent          (peer's Introduction observed)
 *     -> Failed                         (protocol error / I/O failure)
 *   WaitingForUserConsent
 *     -> Receiving                      (user accepts via submitUserConsent(true))
 *     -> Rejected                       (user rejects via submitUserConsent(false))
 *     -> Cancelled                      (user / peer cancel)
 *     -> Failed                         (protocol error / I/O failure)
 *   Receiving
 *     -> Completed                      (every announced payload arrived)
 *     -> Cancelled                      (user / peer cancel)
 *     -> Failed                         (protocol error / I/O failure)
 * ```
 *
 * `Completed`, `Rejected`, `Cancelled`, and `Failed` are terminal — the
 * `StateFlow` will not emit again past them.
