 * before the normal SecureChannel and bandwidth-upgrade negotiation can run.
 *
 * Implementations own a medium-specific advertisement/listener pair, such as a
 * Bluetooth Classic device-name advertisement plus RFCOMM server socket. The
 * accepted stream is handed back as a [ConnectedTransport] and then enters the
 * same inbound protocol stack as a TCP accept.
