/**
 * Derives the two HKDF-SHA256 keys that the Quick Share QR-code path uses.
 *
 * Per PROTOCOL.md "QR codes":
 *
 * ```
 * advertisingToken    = HKDF-SHA256(ikm=keyData, salt="", info="advertisingContext", L=16)
 * nameEncryptionKey   = HKDF-SHA256(ikm=keyData, salt="", info="encryptionKey",      L=16)
 * ```
 *
 * Both info strings are ASCII and are deliberately encoded with `US-ASCII`
 * rather than the platform default to keep the byte representation stable
 * across JVMs and Android API levels (the values fit in ASCII so UTF-8 vs.
 * US-ASCII produces identical bytes; using US-ASCII makes the intent obvious
 * and rules out a future regression if a maintainer ever reuses these
 * constants for something containing non-ASCII characters).
 *
 * The salt is **always empty** for the QR-code path; per RFC 5869 §2.2 an
 * empty salt is replaced internally with `HashLen` (= 32) zero bytes. This is
 * not a property we choose — it's mandated by the protocol — and changing it
 * would break interop with every Quick Share peer in the wild.
 *
 * Sensitive data discipline: never log [QrKeyData] bytes, the derived keys,
 * or the IKM used here. The receiver's name-encryption key in particular
 * gates AAD-bound AES-GCM decryption of the device name; leaking it lets a
 * passive attacker recover the (potentially personal) device name.

/**
 * The two HKDF-derived keys that gate the QR-code matching protocol.
 *
 * Both arrays are exactly [QrKeyDerivation.DERIVED_KEY_LEN] bytes. Equality
 * is value-based on array contents so KAT tests can compare instances with
 * plain `assertEquals`.
 *
 * **Constant-time comparison.** Both fields hold secret HKDF output —
 * [advertisingToken] is the AES-GCM AAD that gates hidden-mode device-name
 * decryption, and [nameEncryptionKey] is the AES-128 key itself. Using
 * `ByteArray.contentEquals` here would short-circuit on the first differing
 * byte and leak a per-byte timing oracle to any caller that can observe
 * comparison latency. We use [MessageDigest.isEqual] instead, which performs
 * a length check followed by an XOR-then-OR loop in time independent of the
 * input contents (since OpenJDK 7u40+ / every Android API level we ship to).
 * Yes, in practice `equals` here is invoked only by KAT tests, but the
 * policy in `:core-protocol` is uniform: never use `contentEquals` on bytes
 * derived from secrets, full stop. See `:core-protocol/README.md` for the
 * project-wide rule.
 *
 * @property advertisingToken 16-byte raw value advertised by the receiver in
 *   visible mode (TLV type=1) and used as AES-GCM AAD in hidden mode.
 * @property nameEncryptionKey 16-byte AES-128 key used to encrypt the device
 *   name in hidden mode.
