 * Internal: the [OutboundConnectionDriver]'s dispatch-loop event union.
 *
 * Three event sources meet at the dispatch loop's `select`:
 *  1. Wire frames coming up from the
 *     [dev.bluehouse.bada.protocol.crypto.securemessage.SecureChannel]
 *     (forwarded by the inbound pump as [Wire]).
 *  2. External user-supplied events
 *     ([OutboundExternalEvent.UserCancel]) arriving on
 *     [OutboundConnection.cancel], wrapped here as [External].
 *  3. Driver-owned timers such as [RemoteAcceptanceTimedOut].
 *  4. The peer closing the TCP half-channel cleanly ([PeerClosed]) or
 *     an unexpected pump-side I/O failure ([PumpError]).
 *
 * Hoisted to its own file so [OutboundConnectionDriver] can stay under
 * the project's 500-line file-size soft target.
