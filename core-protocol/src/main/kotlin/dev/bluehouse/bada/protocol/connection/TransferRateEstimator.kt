/**
 * Smoothed bytes-per-second estimator for an in-flight transfer.
 *
 * Implements an **exponential moving average** of the instantaneous
 * rate samples (`Δbytes / Δseconds`). The smoothing factor is derived
 * from a half-life expressed in seconds — a half-life of 2 s means a
 * rate sample's weight halves every 2 s, so the EMA "remembers" the
 * last few seconds and rejects single-chunk jitter.
 *
 * ### Why EMA over a fixed-size sliding window
 *
 * The Quick Share chunk size is 512 KiB and chunk arrival is bursty:
 * Wi-Fi LAN can deliver several chunks back-to-back in under 10 ms
 * and then stall while the receiver writes to MediaStore. A
 * fixed-size window over chunk count would oscillate between
 * "infinite rate" (zero-time burst) and "zero rate" (write stall).
 * Time-based EMA naturally smooths both extremes — it weights every
 * sample by elapsed wall time, so a write stall draws the average
 * down gradually rather than to zero.
 *
 * ### Numerical stability
 *
 * The EMA uses `α = 1 - exp(-Δt / τ)` where `τ = halfLife / ln(2)`.
 * `Δt` is clamped to `[1 ms, halfLife * 4]` so a clock jump backwards
 * (or a sample arriving more than 4 half-lives apart, which is
 * effectively a fresh transfer) does not produce a negative or
 * runaway alpha.
 *
 * ### Thread-safety
 *
 * **Not thread-safe.** The connection drivers update the estimator
 * from a single per-connection coroutine; sharing one across
 * coroutines requires external synchronization.
 *
 * @param halfLifeMillis Half-life of the EMA in milliseconds. Default
 *   `1500` ms — a 1.5 s half-life rejects the bursty 512 KiB-chunk
 *   jitter while still tracking a real rate change (e.g. the user
 *   moves between rooms and the Wi-Fi link drops a tier) within ~3 s.
