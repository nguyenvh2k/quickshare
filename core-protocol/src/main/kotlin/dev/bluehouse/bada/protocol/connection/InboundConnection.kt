/**
 * The receiver-side glue tying together framing, UKEY2, SecureMessage,
 * and the negotiation state machine into a single in-flight transfer
 * attempt.
 *
 * Wraps exactly one TCP [Socket]. One [InboundConnection] handles one
 * connection from one peer; spawning more connections (Quick Share
 * permits parallel file transfers from different peers) is the caller's
 * responsibility.
 *
 * ### Lifecycle
 *
 * The complete sequence the orchestrator drives, mirroring NearDrop's
 * `InboundNearbyConnection.swift`:
 *
 *  1. Wrap the [Socket] in a [FramedConnection].
 *  2. Read the peer's unencrypted `OfflineFrame{ConnectionRequest}`.
 *     We do not validate `endpoint_info` here -- the discovery layer
 *     handles that -- but its arrival is mandatory.
 *  3. Run [Ukey2Server.performHandshake] to produce a
 *     [Ukey2HandshakeResult].
 *  4. Send unencrypted `OfflineFrame{ConnectionResponse{ACCEPT}}`.
 *  5. Read the peer's unencrypted `OfflineFrame{ConnectionResponse}`.
 *  6. Derive [dev.bluehouse.bada.protocol.crypto.D2DSessionKeys]
 *     with [D2DRole.SERVER]. **This role assignment is critical** --
 *     the receiver responded to UKEY2 (sent ServerInit), so it is the
 *     SERVER on the SecureMessage layer. SERVER sends with
 *     `serverEnc/serverHmac`, receives with `clientEnc/clientHmac`.
 *     A swap here would silently break decryption.
 *  7. Construct a [SecureChannel] over the FramedConnection.
 *  8. Drive [dev.bluehouse.bada.protocol.sharing.InboundSharingFsm]
 *     through to `WaitingForUserConsent` -- pumping inbound BYTES
 *     payloads (assembled by [PayloadAssembler]), parsing them as
 *     `Sharing.Nearby.Frame`s, and feeding the FSM's effect list into
 *     the SecureChannel send path.
 *  9. Surface [TransferMetadata] (filenames, sizes, MIME types, the
 *     UKEY2-derived 4-digit PIN) via [state] and block on
 *     [submitUserConsent].
 * 10. On accept: send `ConnectionResponseFrame{ACCEPT}` (this is the
 *     Sharing-frame variety, NOT the OfflineFrame from step 4 --
 *     same name, different proto), drive the assembler through every
 *     announced FILE / BYTES payload, then send `Disconnection` and
 *     close.
 * 11. On reject: send `ConnectionResponseFrame{REJECT}`, send
 *     `Disconnection`, close.
 *
 * The state machine in
 * [dev.bluehouse.bada.protocol.sharing.InboundSharingFsm] models
 * steps 8-10 as a pure FSM; this class is the surrounding I/O loop
 * that interprets its [dev.bluehouse.bada.protocol.sharing.SharingFsmEffect]
 * outputs.
 *
 * ### Public API
 *
 * The contract is intentionally small:
 *
 *  - [state] -- a [StateFlow] the UI subscribes to for renders.
 *  - [run] -- one-shot suspend entry point that drives the entire
 *    lifecycle and returns an [InboundResult].
 *  - [submitUserConsent] -- thread-safe accept/reject handoff from the
 *    UI; ignored once the FSM has moved past `WaitingForUserConsent`.
 *  - [cancel] -- thread-safe local cancel; produces a `CancelFrame` on
 *    the wire (when possible) and tears the connection down.
 *
 * ### Cancellation
 *
 * Coroutine cancellation of [run] tears down the socket and the
 * assembler's in-flight state cooperatively. The same path is taken
 * when [cancel] is invoked from another coroutine. In either case
 * partial FILE writes are best-effort closed via [PayloadAssembler.reset]
 * so the destination factory can clean up if it wants to (the factory's
 * channel is the only thing that knows the on-disk path).
 *
 * ### Threading model
 *
 * One coroutine owns the receive loop. [submitUserConsent] and
 * [cancel] are safe to call from any other coroutine -- they push
 * onto a [Channel] that the receive loop drains. This avoids racing
 * the FSM with the wire.
 *
 * @param socket A connected TCP socket. Owned by this object: closed
 *   on completion / cancellation / failure regardless of outcome.
 * @param secureRandom Source of randomness for the UKEY2 keypair, the
 *   PairedKeyEncryption fill bytes, and the SecureChannel IVs. Tests
 *   inject a deterministic stub; production uses a fresh
 *   [SecureRandom].
