/**
 * Receiver-side description of an in-flight Quick Share transfer.
 *
 * Surfaced by [InboundConnection] when the receiver's negotiation FSM
 * enters [dev.bluehouse.bada.protocol.sharing.InboundSharingState.WaitingForUserConsent].
 * The UI layer renders this object — file/text counts, sizes, MIME types,
 * and the 4-digit confirmation PIN — to drive the consent sheet.
 *
 * `:core-protocol` is platform-independent, so this type holds plain
 * value semantics: no `Uri`, no `Bitmap`, no `MediaStore`. Higher
 * layers (`:service-android`, `:app`) translate the item list into the
 * appropriate platform notification.
 *
 * ### Why a single immutable snapshot
 *
 * The UI needs all metadata at once (the consent sheet is rendered in
 * one shot), so a single `data class` carrying a list of items plus the
 * PIN is the smallest API surface that gets the job done. We do NOT
 * surface the raw [IntroductionFrame] proto here — that would leak
 * platform-irrelevant fields (`required_package`, `app_metadata`,
 * `wifi_credentials_metadata`, ...) and force the UI to know the proto
 * shape. The mapping in [fromIntroductionFrame] keeps the proto
 * dependency in one place.
 *
 * @property items One entry per file or text payload announced in the
 *   peer's introduction. Empty if the introduction announced no
 *   file/text items (Quick Share also supports Wi-Fi credential and app
 *   transfers; we ignore those for Phase 1).
 * @property pin 4-digit ASCII confirmation code derived from the UKEY2
 *   `authString` via [dev.bluehouse.bada.protocol.crypto.pin.PinDerivation.deriveFourDigitPin].
 *   Always exactly 4 ASCII digits.
 * @property sourceDeviceName Optional human-readable name of the sender
 *   device, decoded from the peer's `endpoint_info` carried in the
 *   `ConnectionRequest`. `null` when the sender advertised in
 *   "hidden" visibility mode (no name on the wire) or when the
 *   `endpoint_info` could not be parsed. The receiver UI (#22)
 *   renders this on the consent notification / dialog so the user
 *   knows who is asking for permission to send.
