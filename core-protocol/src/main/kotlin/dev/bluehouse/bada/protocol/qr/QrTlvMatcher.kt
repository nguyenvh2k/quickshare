/**
 * Sender-side helpers that decide whether a discovered receiver's
 * EndpointInfo is the one we just QR-bonded with.
 *
 * The sender holds the QR code's [DerivedQrKeys] (derived from the keypair
 * it generated). Each discovered receiver advertises an EndpointInfo that
 * may carry a TLV record of `type=1` whose value is one of:
 *
 *  - **Visible mode**: the 16-byte raw advertising token. Match by direct
 *    constant-time byte equality against our token.
 *  - **Hidden mode**: `IV(12) || AES-GCM ciphertext(name) || tag(16)`.
 *    Match by attempting AES-GCM decryption with our `nameEncryptionKey`
 *    and `advertisingToken` AAD; on success the plaintext is the device
 *    name and we connect.
 *
 * Both checks are wrapped in [matches], which inspects every type=1 TLV in
 * the advertisement and returns a structured [QrMatchResult] so the caller
 * (the sender's connection logic, landing in #24) can route the connect
 * the same way regardless of which mode matched.
 *
 * **Constant-time comparison.** Plain `ByteArray.contentEquals` short-
 * circuits on the first differing byte, which leaks information about how
 * many leading bytes of the advertising token an attacker has guessed
 * correctly. We use [MessageDigest.isEqual] instead, which is documented to
 * run in time independent of the inputs (matching the secret length, at
 * least). This matters even though the advertising token is 16 random
 * bytes: if a future PROTOCOL revision introduces low-entropy tokens, the
 * caller side stays safe.
