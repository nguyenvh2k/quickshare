/**
 * Authenticated, ordered, encrypted bidirectional channel for `OfflineFrame`
 * messages on top of a [FramedConnection].
 *
 * This is the layer that sits between the raw length-prefixed TCP framing
 * (`FramedConnection`, issue #7) and the higher-level protocol state
 * machines (`OfflineFrame` handlers, issue #15+). After a successful UKEY2
 * handshake, the rest of the Quick Share connection consists exclusively of
 * `SecureMessage`-wrapped `OfflineFrame`s flowing in both directions, each
 * carrying a strictly increasing sequence number.
 *
 * ### Owned state
 *
 *  - **`DirectionalKeys`** — the four 32-byte symmetric keys
 *    (`sendEncryptKey`, `sendHmacKey`, `receiveEncryptKey`, `receiveHmacKey`)
 *    selected from the [D2DSessionKeys] bundle by
 *    [D2DSessionKeys.forRole]. The channel never copies these arrays; it
 *    holds the references for its lifetime and zeroes nothing on close
 *    (the JVM does not give us a portable way to zero a `ByteArray` and
 *    have it stay zeroed across GC moves; the rest of the stack relies on
 *    process isolation).
 *  - **`mySeq`** — the next sequence number to assign on send. Starts at
 *    `0` and is **pre-incremented** before each send (matching NearDrop's
 *    Swift `sendSequenceNumber += 1` followed by use of the new value).
 *    The first frame sent therefore carries `sequence_number = 1`.
 *  - **`theirSeq`** — the next sequence number expected on receive. Same
 *    pre-increment semantics: the first valid received frame must carry
 *    `sequence_number = 1`. Anything else is a protocol error.
 *
 * Counters are `Long` rather than `Int` to match the protobuf `int32`'s
 * full positive range (up to `Int.MAX_VALUE`). Promoting to `Long`
 * internally also keeps the increment from silently rolling over if a
 * connection ever lasted long enough to send 2 billion frames (it won't,
 * but the cost of being defensive is one extra byte per counter).
 *
 * ### Thread / coroutine safety
 *
 * Internally we use one [Mutex] for the send half and another for the
 * receive half — same rationale as [FramedConnection]'s read/write split:
 * a Quick Share connection is fully duplex, so concurrent send + receive
 * must not contend. Two coroutines must NOT call [sendOfflineFrame]
 * simultaneously (the second blocks on the mutex; the resulting on-wire
 * order is non-deterministic). Same for [receiveOfflineFrame].
 *
 * ### Failure model
 *
 * Every receive-side failure is **fatal to the channel**. The channel is
 * intentionally designed to NOT recover from any of:
 *
 *  - HMAC signature mismatch ([SecureMessageVerificationException]).
 *  - Malformed proto, missing fields, or unsupported crypto schemes
 *    ([SecureMessageFormatException]).
 *  - AES decrypt failure ([SecureMessageCryptoException] — should be
 *    unreachable past the HMAC check, but we surface it explicitly).
 *  - Sequence-number mismatch ([SequenceNumberMismatchException]).
 *
 * After any of these, the channel's internal counters and the underlying
 * socket are left in whatever state the failure produced, and callers
 * MUST close the connection. We do not try to resynchronize. This matches
 * NearDrop's `protocolError()` path.
 *
 * @param framedConnection The transport. Owned by the caller (not closed
 *   by [close]); the channel only delegates `sendFrame`/`receiveFrame`.
 * @param sessionKeys The full key bundle from
 *   [dev.bluehouse.bada.protocol.crypto.D2DKeyDerivation.derive].
 *   The channel resolves [DirectionalKeys] internally via
 *   [D2DSessionKeys.forRole] so callers cannot accidentally pass the
 *   wrong direction.
 * @param secureRandom Source of IV randomness. Production callers should
 *   pass a default [SecureRandom]; tests pass a deterministic stub to
 *   reproduce exact ciphertexts.
