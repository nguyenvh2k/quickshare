/**
 * Protocol-wide constants and the handshake result type for the Quick Share
 * UKEY2 cipher-commitment-then-reveal key exchange.
 *
 * UKEY2 is Google's bespoke key-exchange protocol that opens every Quick
 * Share connection. The client publishes a `SHA512(ClientFinished)`
 * commitment up-front, the server picks a cipher and replies with its
 * ephemeral public key, and only then does the client reveal the actual
 * `ClientFinished` (containing its own ephemeral public key). Because the
 * commitment is bound to the cipher choice **before** the server gets to
 * see the client's public key, a man-in-the-middle cannot rewrite the
 * cipher list without invalidating the commitment.
 *
 * For Quick Share specifically there is exactly one cipher in the wild —
 * `P256_SHA512` (NIST P-256 ECDH + SHA-512 commitments) — and the
 * negotiated `next_protocol` is fixed at `"AES_256_CBC-HMAC_SHA256"`.
 * Anything else triggers a [Ukey2HandshakeException] and a `Ukey2Alert`
 * frame back to the peer.
 *
 * See [issue #10](https://github.com/kyujin-cho/Bada/issues/10)
 * and [google/ukey2](https://github.com/google/ukey2) for the full spec.

 *
 * The fields here are exactly what downstream UKEY2-derivation code (issue
 * #11) consumes:
 *
 *  - [dhs] is `SHA-256(ECDH-shared-secret-X-magnitude)`. Per NearDrop's
 *    `finalizeKeyExchange()`, the X coordinate of the shared point is
 *    converted to its **magnitude** representation (unsigned big-endian
 *    with leading zero bytes stripped) **before** hashing. This matters: a
 *    raw 32-byte coordinate that happens to start with `0x00` would
 *    produce a different SHA-256 hash than a stripped 31-byte magnitude.
 *    Bit-perfect parity with the macOS reference implementation requires
 *    matching the magnitude form.
 *
 *  - [clientInitMsg] and [serverInitMsg] are the **raw serialized
 *    `Ukey2Message` bytes** for ClientInit and ServerInit respectively
 *    (i.e., the protobuf wrapper, NOT length-prefixed and NOT the inner
 *    `Ukey2ClientInit` / `Ukey2ServerInit` payload). They are concatenated
 *    as the HKDF `info` parameter when deriving the next-protocol session
 *    keys (`UKEY2 v1 next` salt) and the auth string (`UKEY2 v1 auth`
 *    salt). Storing them is mandatory; the peer cannot recompute them
 *    locally because each side has a private random nonce.
 *
 * @property dhs SHA-256 of the ECDH shared secret X-magnitude. 32 bytes.
 * @property clientInitMsg Serialized `Ukey2Message` wrapping the
 *   `Ukey2ClientInit` we sent (client role) or received (server role).
 * @property serverInitMsg Serialized `Ukey2Message` wrapping the
 *   `Ukey2ServerInit` we received (client role) or sent (server role).
