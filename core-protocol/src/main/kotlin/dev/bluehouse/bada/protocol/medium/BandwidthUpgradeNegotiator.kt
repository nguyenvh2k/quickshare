/**
 * Pure FSM for the `BANDWIDTH_UPGRADE_NEGOTIATION` event sequence.
 *
 * Events in (`BandwidthUpgradeEvent`), effects out
 * (`BandwidthUpgradeEffect`). The negotiator owns no I/O — same shape
 * as `OutboundSharingFsm` / `InboundSharingFsm`. The orchestrator
 * (`OutboundConnection` / `InboundConnection`, via the registry's
 * provider) feeds it inbound frames and externally-driven decisions
 * ("start the upgrade"); the negotiator returns a list of effects the
 * orchestrator applies to the wire and the transport.
 *
 * ### Roles
 *
 *  - **Server role.** The receiver. Initiates the upgrade by emitting
 *    [BandwidthUpgradeEffect.SendFrame] of `UPGRADE_PATH_AVAILABLE`,
 *    waits for `CLIENT_INTRODUCTION`, ACKs it, then runs the
 *    `LAST_WRITE` / `SAFE_TO_CLOSE` exchange.
 *  - **Client role.** The sender. Waits for `UPGRADE_PATH_AVAILABLE`,
 *    asks the orchestrator to adopt the new transport via
 *    [BandwidthUpgradeEffect.AdoptTransport], then sends
 *    `CLIENT_INTRODUCTION`, waits for the ACK, runs the `LAST_WRITE` /
 *    `SAFE_TO_CLOSE` exchange.
 *
 * ### Why a single FSM for both roles
 *
 * The events are role-symmetric: every wire event goes through the
 * same parser, and the effect each transition produces depends only on
 * the current state and the role. Splitting into two FSMs would force
 * the orchestrator to track a third "which negotiator should I
 * forward to" boolean, which buys nothing.
 *
 * ### Default-off framework
 *
 * The negotiator is **not** automatically wired into the connection
 * lifecycles. The orchestrator instantiates one (with the chosen
 * [Medium]) only when the receiver decides to upgrade or when the
 * sender observes an inbound `UPGRADE_PATH_AVAILABLE`. Today (Phase 1)
 * neither path fires, so the FSM exists for the per-medium adapters in
 * #49–#53 to plug into. The unit tests in this PR exercise the FSM in
 * isolation; #54 wires it into the connection drivers.
