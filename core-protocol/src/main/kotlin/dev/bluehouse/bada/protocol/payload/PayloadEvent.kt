/**
 * Result of feeding a single `PayloadTransferFrame` into [PayloadAssembler].
 *
 * The assembler is fundamentally a state machine that consumes one chunk at
 * a time. Most chunks merely advance internal state and return
 * [Progress] (or [Ignored] for non-DATA packets we do not assemble). Only
 * the final chunk of a payload — the one carrying `LAST_CHUNK` — produces a
 * terminal event ([BytesComplete] or [FileComplete]).
 *
 * The sealed hierarchy lets the higher-level state machine (issue #15+)
 * dispatch on the *kind* of progress without having to inspect the proto
 * itself, and lets unit tests assert on a typed value rather than on a
 * grab-bag of out parameters.
 *
 * ### Why this is a return value rather than a callback
 *
 * The receive coroutine in [dev.bluehouse.bada.protocol.crypto.securemessage.SecureChannel]
 * already owns the read loop. Letting the assembler return events lets the
 * caller decide what to do (forward up the stack, log, drop) without
 * pulling coroutine machinery into the assembler itself. This keeps the
 * assembler a pure synchronous state machine that is trivially unit
 * testable on the JVM.
