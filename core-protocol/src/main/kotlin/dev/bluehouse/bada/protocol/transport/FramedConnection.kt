/**
 * Length-prefixed framing layer for the Quick Share TCP transport.
 *
 * Every protobuf message exchanged on a Quick Share connection is preceded
 * by a **4-byte big-endian unsigned length prefix**. This class is the
 * lowest layer of the protocol stack: it does not interpret the payload at
 * all — it only delimits frames so higher layers (UKEY2, SecureMessage,
 * `OfflineFrame`, payload chunks) can decode whole messages without
 * over-reading.
 *
 * Reference: NearDrop's `NearbyShare/NearbyConnection.swift`
 * (`receiveFrameAsync` / `sendFrameAsync`). We deliberately mirror the same
 * 4-byte big-endian wire format, the same 5 MiB sanity cap on incoming
 * frames, and the same separation between graceful end-of-stream and
 * protocol-level errors.
 *
 * ### Threading model
 *
 * The constructor accepts a plain blocking [Socket]. All read/write work
 * is dispatched onto [Dispatchers.IO] so callers can invoke
 * [sendFrame]/[receiveFrame] from any coroutine context without blocking
 * an event-loop thread. Cancelling the calling coroutine does **not**
 * automatically interrupt an in-flight blocking read; callers that need
 * eager cancellation should also close the socket.
 *
 * ### Concurrency
 *
 * Reads and writes use independent locks (one for the input side, one for
 * the output side). It is therefore safe to call [sendFrame] and
 * [receiveFrame] from two different coroutines concurrently — that is
 * actually the expected pattern, since Quick Share is bidirectional. It
 * is **not** safe to invoke [receiveFrame] from two coroutines at once;
 * the second call will simply block on the read lock.
 *
 * ### Lifecycle
 *
 * [FramedConnection] does not own the socket's network lifecycle. Callers
 * are expected to close the socket (and any owning resource) through the
 * usual `Socket.close()` path; [close] on this object is a convenience
 * that simply forwards to the underlying socket.
