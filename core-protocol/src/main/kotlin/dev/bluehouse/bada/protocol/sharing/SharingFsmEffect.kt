/**
 * Outputs produced by a Quick Share negotiation state machine in
 * response to a single [SharingFsmEvent].
 *
 * The FSM never performs I/O directly — every external action it would
 * like to take is reified as one of these effects, returned to the
 * orchestrator (issues #16 / #17 / #22) which interprets them:
 *
 *  - [SendFrame] is sent through the BYTES-payload encoder
 *    ([dev.bluehouse.bada.protocol.payload.PayloadTransferEncoder.encodeBytesPayload])
 *    and the resulting `OfflineFrame`s are pushed through the
 *    [dev.bluehouse.bada.protocol.crypto.securemessage.SecureChannel].
 *  - [IntroductionReceived] tells the receiver UI to show the consent
 *    sheet for the announced files / text.
 *  - [ReadyToReceivePayloads] / [ReadyToSendPayloads] is the gate that
 *    file streaming waits on; until it fires, no FILE / BYTES
 *    application payloads are produced or accepted.
 *  - [Rejected] / [Cancelled] / [Completed] / [ProtocolError] are all
 *    terminal notifications. After any of these, the FSM is in
 *    [InboundSharingState.Disconnected] / [OutboundSharingState.Disconnected]
 *    and further events return an empty effect list.
 *
 * The list returned by `onEvent` is ordered: effects must be applied in
 * the listed order. In practice that means a state transition that
 * sends a frame *and* completes the FSM (for example, sender's
 * `IntroductionFrame` → `ConnectionResponseFrame{ACCEPT}` does not
 * complete it, but receiver's `UserConsent(accept=false)` does)
 * surfaces the [SendFrame] before the [Rejected] / [Cancelled] /
 * [Completed] notifier so the orchestrator pushes the bytes onto the
 * wire before it tears the connection down.
