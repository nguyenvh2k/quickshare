/**
 * Snapshot of an in-flight Quick Share transfer's throughput.
 *
 * Surfaced as part of [InboundConnectionState.Receiving] /
 * [OutboundConnectionState.Sending] so observers can render rate +
 * ETA without reaching into the connection driver internals.
 *
 * Pure-JVM value type — no Android imports — so the same shape can
 * back the receiver foreground notification (#46), the sender status
 * panel (#46), and any future surface (e.g. a transfer history log)
 * without re-deriving the maths.
 *
 * Issue #46 acceptance criteria:
 *
 *  - Rate calculated as exponential moving average of recent
 *    bytes/second (smooths over jitter).
 *  - ETA = `(total - transferred) / current_rate`.
 *
 * Both fields are *defensive* about insufficient data: a brand-new
 * transfer with one sample has [bytesPerSecond] = 0 and [etaSeconds] =
 * `null`, which the UI is expected to render as "calculating…" rather
 * than "0 B/s, unknown ETA".
 *
 * @property bytesTransferred Cumulative bytes transferred so far.
 *   Always `>= 0`. Caps at `totalSize` once the transfer completes.
 * @property totalSize Total bytes announced for the transfer. Always
 *   `>= 0`. May be `0` for transfers that announced no payloads
 *   (rare; the orchestrator publishes a placeholder snapshot during
 *   negotiation).
 * @property bytesPerSecond Smoothed instantaneous throughput in bytes
 *   per second. `0` while warming up (fewer than two samples) or after
 *   a long idle gap that drains the EMA below 1 B/s. Always `>= 0`.
 * @property etaSeconds Estimated seconds until completion. `null` when
 *   the rate is `0` (cannot divide), when [bytesTransferred] already
 *   meets [totalSize] (transfer is essentially done), or when
 *   [totalSize] is `0` (no announced payload). Always `>= 0` when
 *   non-null.
