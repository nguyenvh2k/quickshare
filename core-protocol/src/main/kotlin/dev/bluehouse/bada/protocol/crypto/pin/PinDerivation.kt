/**
 * Derives the 4-digit visual confirmation PIN that Quick Share displays on
 * both peers after the UKEY2 handshake completes.
 *
 * The algorithm is **not** the one specified by UKEY2 itself; it is a
 * Chromium-specific construction that NearDrop ports verbatim in
 * `NearbyConnection.swift:pinCodeFromAuthKey`. Both peers must produce the
 * same digits for the same `authString`, so this implementation is required
 * to be bit-exact with the Swift reference. Reproduced for clarity:
 *
 * ```swift
 * internal static func pinCodeFromAuthKey(_ key: SymmetricKey) -> String {
 *     var hash: Int = 0
 *     var multiplier: Int = 1
 *     let keyBytes: [UInt8] = key.withUnsafeBytes({ return [UInt8]($0) })
 *     for _byte in keyBytes {
 *         let byte = Int(Int8(bitPattern: _byte))
 *         hash = (hash + byte * multiplier) % 9973
 *         multiplier = (multiplier * 31) % 9973
 *     }
 *     return String(format: "%04d", abs(hash))
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ### Why the implementation is one line of arithmetic but the contract is subtle
 *
 *  1. **Signed bytes.** Swift goes out of its way to reinterpret each `UInt8`
 *     as `Int8` before widening to `Int`. The JVM's `Byte` is already signed
 *     and `Byte.toInt()` sign-extends (`0xFF.toByte().toInt() == -1`), so on
 *     the JVM side `b.toInt()` is sufficient — but only if it goes through
 *     `Byte.toInt()` on a `Byte` value. Going through `Int.and(0xFF)` would
 *     silently produce zero-extended (unsigned) values and break interop on
 *     any peer that ever exchanges an authString with a high bit set. The
 *     test suite pins this down with explicit `0xFF`-byte vectors.
 *
 *  2. **Truncated remainder.** Swift's `%` operator and Kotlin's `%`
 *     operator on `Int` both use **truncated** division (the result carries
 *     the sign of the dividend). Languages that implement floored division
 *     (Python's `%`, Lua's `%`, etc.) would diverge here when `hash` goes
 *     negative. We therefore intentionally do not reach for any
 *     `Math.floorMod` helper.
 *
 *  3. **`abs` on the final hash is bounded.** After the modulo, `hash` is
 *     always in `(-9973, 9973)`, so `kotlin.math.abs(Int)` cannot hit the
 *     `Int.MIN_VALUE` undefined-behaviour edge that bites generic JVM code.
 *
 *  4. **Output is exactly 4 ASCII digits.** Zero-padded with leading zeros.
 *     `"%04d"` in Java/Kotlin matches Swift's format string here because
 *     `abs(hash) <= 9972 < 10000` so the field never overflows past 4
 *     characters.
 *
 *  5. **Pure function — no key material is logged or returned.** Only the
 *     4-digit string escapes this object. Callers are still responsible for
 *     not logging the `authString` argument; this helper has no logging at
 *     all by design.
 *
 *  6. **Empty `authString`.** Defined to return `"0000"`: the loop runs zero
 *     times, `hash` stays `0`, `abs(0) = 0`, formatted as `0000`. We do not
 *     reject empty input — defining the boundary is cheaper than asking
 *     every caller to pre-validate, and matches the Swift reference, which
 *     also returns `"0000"` for an empty key buffer.
 *
 * ### Public API
 *
 * One function: [deriveFourDigitPin]. The companion KAT vectors live in
 * `:core-protocol-test` (`PinVectors`) so the same answer-table can be
 * reused from Android instrumentation tests when the protocol stack lights
 * up later in Phase 1.
