/**
 * Ordered preference list used to pick **one** medium out of the
 * intersection between the local device's supported set and the peer's
 * advertised set on `ConnectionRequestFrame.mediums`.
 *
 * The order encodes the project's bandwidth-vs-availability heuristic:
 *
 *  1. **Wi-Fi Aware** — direct NAN data path when both chipsets support it.
 *  2. **Wi-Fi Direct** — peer-to-peer Wi-Fi, no router in the middle.
 *  3. **Wi-Fi Hotspot** — same bandwidth ceiling as LAN, but requires
 *     standing up a soft-AP (slow on cold start).
 *  4. **Wi-Fi LAN** — the already-open discovery transport.
 *  5. **WebRTC** — internet-relayed; only relevant when both peers
 *     have connectivity but no shared LAN.
 *  6. **BLE L2CAP** — meaningful throughput on the LE radio (≈ 1 Mbps
 *     on BT 5+); preferred over RFCOMM for the file-transfer phase.
 *  7. **Bluetooth (RFCOMM)** — slowest of the bulk-transfer mediums but
 *     extremely widely supported; the universal fallback.
 *  8. **BLE (GATT)** — discovery-only in practice; left in the ladder
 *     so a future "tiny payload over GATT" path stays expressible.
 *
 * The default is exposed as [Default]; a per-call override can be
 * passed to [MediumRegistry.selectBestUpgrade] when integration tests
 * or specific UX flows want a different ordering (e.g. forcing a
 * Wi-Fi-Direct-first run).
