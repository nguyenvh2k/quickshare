/**
 * Strategy for choosing the destination of an inbound FILE payload.
 *
 * Why a factory and not a fixed [Path]? Quick Share has no notion of
 * "save into this exact path"; every received file gets a destination
 * decided by the host platform:
 *
 *  - On Android we spool bytes through a private-storage `RandomAccessFile`
 *    until the transfer completes, then publish the spool file's bytes
 *    into `MediaStore` / `ContentResolver` on commit. The `WritableByteChannel`
 *    surface alone is not enough — issue #44 added support for chunks
 *    arriving out of order (necessary once we add Wi-Fi Direct or BLE
 *    L2CAP mediums in #4.x) and that requires `SeekableByteChannel.position`.
 *  - On the JVM (host-side test harness, or a hypothetical desktop port)
 *    we want a real file on disk under a configurable directory; a
 *    `FileChannel` from `Files.newByteChannel` already implements
 *    [SeekableByteChannel].
 *  - For unit tests we want an in-memory channel so we can assert on the
 *    exact bytes that were written without touching the filesystem; a
 *    small `ByteBuffer`-backed [SeekableByteChannel] adapter is enough.
 *
 * `:core-protocol` lives below the platform line (no `android.*` imports
 * are allowed), so the assembler cannot itself open a `MediaStore`
 * destination. Instead we accept a factory that the caller — typically
 * `:service-android` — provides to bridge the gap. The factory is invoked
 * exactly once per FILE payload, immediately after the assembler observes
 * the payload's first chunk.
 *
 * The factory contract:
 *  - It MUST return a [SeekableByteChannel] in a state ready to accept
 *    `header.total_size` bytes worth of `write()` calls at arbitrary
 *    offsets. The channel is opened with the cursor at byte 0; the
 *    assembler calls [SeekableByteChannel.position] before each write
 *    so a chunk that arrives out of order lands at its declared offset.
 *  - Implementations MAY pre-allocate the destination to `total_size`
 *    bytes (e.g. by truncating to the final size up front) but the
 *    assembler does not require it.
 *  - The assembler closes the channel exactly once: either on the
 *    `LAST_CHUNK` of a successful payload, or as part of cleanup when a
 *    later chunk of that payload causes a [PayloadProtocolException]. The
 *    factory MUST NOT close it itself.
 *  - If the factory throws, the assembler propagates the exception and
 *    no channel allocation has leaked.
 *
 * ### Commit / abort lifecycle
 *
 * Some platforms (notably Android `MediaStore` writes) need an explicit
 * publish step *after* the assembler closes the channel: the bytes are
 * written into a "pending" slot and only become visible to the user once
 * the receiver confirms the payload completed cleanly. Other factories
 * (TempFile, in-memory) have no such distinction — close-on-success is
 * enough.
 *
 * To accommodate both shapes without leaking platform concerns into
 * `:core-protocol`, the factory exposes three lifecycle hooks with
 * **no-op defaults** so simple factories can ignore them:
 *
 *  - [commit] -- the receiver observed `PayloadEvent.FileComplete` for
 *    [payloadId]. Publish the bytes (clear `IS_PENDING`, rename the
 *    `.part` placeholder, etc.). Idempotent: a second call is a no-op.
 *  - [abort] -- the connection terminated abnormally **for this single
 *    payload**. Discard the partial bytes (delete the row, unlink the
 *    file). Idempotent: a second call is a no-op.
 *  - [abortAll] -- the connection terminated abnormally and the caller
 *    does not have a list of in-flight payload ids. Discard every
 *    untracked partial. Equivalent to calling [abort] for each currently
 *    open payload.
 *
 * The [dev.bluehouse.bada.protocol.connection.InboundConnection]
 * orchestrator is the canonical caller of these hooks: [commit] from the
 * `FileComplete` path, [abortAll] from every cancel / failure / error
 * path. Receiver-initiated mid-transfer cancel guarantees no partial
 * file remains visible to the user.
