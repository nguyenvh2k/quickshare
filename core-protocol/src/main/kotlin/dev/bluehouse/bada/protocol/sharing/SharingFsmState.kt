/**
 * States of the **inbound** Quick Share negotiation FSM.
 *
 * The naming mirrors NearDrop's `InboundNearbyConnection.State` (Swift
 * reference implementation), which mirrors stock Android Quick Share's
 * receive-side phase machine. Some states from NearDrop's enum are NOT
 * present here because they correspond to handshake / transport-layer
 * phases that this codebase splits across earlier modules:
 *
 *  - `initial`, `receivedConnectionRequest`, `sentUkeyServerInit`,
 *    `receivedUkeyClientFinish`, `sentConnectionResponse` — handled by
 *    [dev.bluehouse.bada.protocol.transport.FramedConnection]
 *    + [dev.bluehouse.bada.protocol.ukey2.Ukey2Server] (issues
 *    #7 / #10). The FSM in this module starts AFTER that handshake,
 *    in [SentPairedKeyEncryption].
 *  - `receivingFiles` — the post-negotiation file-streaming phase
 *    (issues #16 / #19 / #23). The FSM marks the boundary by emitting
 *    [SharingFsmEffect.ReadyToReceivePayloads] and transitioning to
 *    [Disconnected] only on cancel / error / completion of file
 *    streaming, which is reported back in by the orchestrator. To keep
 *    THIS module pure-FSM, [ReceivingPayloads] is the post-consent
 *    state and the orchestrator owns the actual file I/O.
 *
 * Transition diagram (`->` is a state transition, `(emit X)` is the
 * effects produced):
 *
 * ```
 *   [enter] -> SentPairedKeyEncryption           (emit SendFrame{PKE})
 *   SentPairedKeyEncryption
 *     +-- Frame{PAIRED_KEY_ENCRYPTION}      ->  ReceivedPairedKeyEncryption (emit SendFrame{PKR=UNABLE})
 *     +-- Frame{CANCEL}                     ->  Disconnected               (emit Cancelled)
 *     +-- UserCancel                        ->  Disconnected               (emit SendFrame{CANCEL}, Cancelled)
 *     +-- *                                 ->  Disconnected               (emit ProtocolError)
 *
 *   ReceivedPairedKeyEncryption -> SentPairedKeyResult (transition is implicit; see code)
 *   SentPairedKeyResult
 *     +-- Frame{PAIRED_KEY_RESULT}          ->  ReceivedPairedKeyResult
 *     ... (CANCEL / ProtocolError as above)
 *
 *   ReceivedPairedKeyResult
 *     +-- Frame{INTRODUCTION}               ->  WaitingForUserConsent      (emit IntroductionReceived)
 *     +-- Frame{RESPONSE, status=ACCEPT|UNKNOWN}
 *                                            ->  ReceivedPairedKeyResult    (ignore sender pre-consent)
 *     ... (CANCEL / ProtocolError as above)
 *
 *   WaitingForUserConsent
 *     +-- UserConsent(true)   ->  ReceivingPayloads
 *           (emit SendFrame{RESPONSE=ACCEPT}, ReadyToReceivePayloads, Completed)
 *     +-- UserConsent(false)  ->  Disconnected
 *           (emit SendFrame{RESPONSE=REJECT}, Rejected, Cancelled)
 *     ... (CANCEL / ProtocolError as above)
