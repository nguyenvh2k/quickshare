/**
 * Internal: the [InboundConnectionDriver]'s dispatch-loop event union.
 *
 * Three event sources meet at the dispatch loop's `select`:
 *  1. Wire frames coming up from the [dev.bluehouse.bada.protocol.crypto.securemessage.SecureChannel]
 *     (forwarded by the inbound pump as [Wire]).
 *  2. External user-supplied events ([ExternalEvent.UserConsent],
 *     [ExternalEvent.UserCancel]) arriving on
 *     [InboundConnection.submitUserConsent] / [InboundConnection.cancel],
 *     wrapped here as [External].
 *  3. The peer closing the TCP half-channel cleanly ([PeerClosed]) or
 *     an unexpected pump-side I/O failure ([PumpError]).
 *
 * Hoisted to its own file so [InboundConnectionDriver] can stay under
 * the project's 500-line file-size soft target.
