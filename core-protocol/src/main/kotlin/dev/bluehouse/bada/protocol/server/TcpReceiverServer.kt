/**
 * TCP listener that accepts inbound Quick Share connections and runs each
 * one through the receiver-side state machine
 * ([dev.bluehouse.bada.protocol.connection.InboundConnection]).
 *
 * ## Why this lives in `:core-protocol`
 *
 * Despite owning long-lived sockets, the implementation is pure-JVM: it
 * uses [java.net.ServerSocket] / [Socket] / [java.io.InputStream] only.
 * No `android.*` imports are required, so the natural home is
 * `:core-protocol` next to the rest of the protocol stack. Android-side
 * concerns (foreground service hosting, MediaStore-backed
 * [FileDestinationFactory], notifications) wrap this class from
 * `:service-android` (#21).
 *
 * ## Lifecycle
 *
 * 1. Caller invokes [start]; this binds a [ServerSocket] on `0.0.0.0:0`
 *    (kernel-assigned ephemeral port) and returns the bound port.
 * 2. A background coroutine runs an `accept()` loop on [Dispatchers.IO].
 * 3. Each accepted [Socket] is handed to a fresh [InboundConnection],
 *    launched as a child of this server's scope using [SupervisorJob] so
 *    one transfer's failure cannot kill the listener or sibling
 *    transfers.
 * 4. Per-connection results (success / reject / cancel / failure) flow
 *    out through [results] for higher layers to observe.
 * 5. [stop] closes the listener (which interrupts the blocked `accept()`),
 *    cancels every in-flight per-connection coroutine, and joins them.
 *
 * The chosen port is what the discovery layer (#18) advertises in its
 * Quick Share mDNS SRV record. Calling [start] before publishing mDNS is
 * mandatory: peers connect by IP+port, so the SRV record needs a real
 * bound value, not `0`.
 *
 * ## Concurrency
 *
 * - The listener owns a [SupervisorJob] child of the caller's scope. We
 *   use [SupervisorJob] (not a plain [Job]) so a per-connection failure
 *   does not cancel the accept loop or other in-flight transfers — Quick
 *   Share permits parallel inbound connections from different peers, and
 *   one bad sender must not poison the others.
 * - `accept()` is wrapped in [runInterruptible] on [Dispatchers.IO] so
 *   coroutine cancellation eagerly interrupts the blocked thread. Closing
 *   the [ServerSocket] from [stop] additionally surfaces a
 *   [SocketException] which the loop treats as the graceful exit signal.
 * - TCP_NODELAY is set on every accepted [Socket] (matches NearDrop's
 *   `tcp.noDelay = true` in `startOutgoingTransfer`) so small
 *   protocol frames are not Nagle-delayed.
 *
 * ## Public API
 *
 * The contract is intentionally tight:
 *
 *  - [start] -- bind, spawn the accept loop, return the bound port.
 *    Idempotent against repeated calls (throws [IllegalStateException]).
 *  - [stop] -- close the listener and cancel every per-connection job.
 *    Safe to call before [start] (no-op) and to call repeatedly.
 *  - [boundPort] -- the chosen ephemeral port; valid only between
 *    [start] returning and [stop].
 *  - [results] -- a [SharedFlow] of [InboundResult]s, one per connection
 *    that ran to completion. Replay = 0 (a result observed once is
 *    consumed); buffer = 64 to absorb bursts.
 *
 * @param parentScope The caller's coroutine scope. The server creates a
 *   [SupervisorJob] child of this scope; cancelling the parent
 *   propagates to every per-connection coroutine. The natural choice on
 *   Android is the foreground service's `lifecycleScope`.
 * @param factoryProvider Supplies a fresh [FileDestinationFactory] per
 *   accepted connection. Why a `() -> FileDestinationFactory` rather
 *   than a single shared factory? Some factories (notably the Android
 *   `MediaStore`-backed one) hold per-transfer state — an opened
 *   `ContentResolver` connection, a transfer-scoped sub-directory, etc.
 *   Re-using the same factory across connections would bleed state from
 *   one transfer into the next. The provider is invoked exactly once
 *   per `accept()`; tests pass `{ TempFileDestinationFactory() }`.
 * @param secureRandomProvider Source of randomness for each
 *   [InboundConnection] (UKEY2 keypairs, IVs). Default is a fresh
 *   [SecureRandom] per connection; tests inject a deterministic stub.
 * @param bindAddress Optional bind address. Defaults to `0.0.0.0`
 *   (`InetAddress.getByName("0.0.0.0")` -- accept on every interface).
 *   Tests typically pass `InetAddress.getLoopbackAddress()` to avoid
 *   binding to the host's external NIC.
 * @param preBoundSocket Optional already-bound listener to ADOPT instead
 *   of binding a fresh one. Used by the NFC cold tap-to-receive path
 *   (`NfcColdReceiverPrimer`): the HCE callback binds a [ServerSocket]
 *   synchronously and advertises its port in the NFC tag, then the
 *   receiver session adopts that exact socket here so the accept loop
 *   drains the connection the sender already queued on the advertised
 *   port. When non-null, [bindAddress] is ignored (the socket is already
 *   bound) and the server takes ownership: [stop] closes it.
 * @param logger diagnostic sink for per-connection protocol events.
