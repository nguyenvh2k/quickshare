/**
 * Pure-Kotlin domain enum mirroring the wire-level `Medium` enums used
 * by `ConnectionRequestFrame.Medium` and
 * `BandwidthUpgradeNegotiationFrame.UpgradePathInfo.Medium`.
 *
 * Every Quick Share medium that the framework is willing to surface to
 * adapters has exactly one entry here. The two proto enums are
 * structurally identical (same wire numbers and names) but live in
 * different message scopes; routing both through this single domain enum
 * keeps the adapter contract — [MediumProvider] — independent of which
 * proto field a value is being read from or written to.
 *
 * Adapters in `:discovery-android` (Phase 4 sub-issues #49–#53) declare
 * their support against this enum; the framework converts to the
 * appropriate proto enum at the wire boundary.
 *
 * The wire-numbers field is asserted by [MediumWireMappingTest] so the
 * mapping cannot drift if a future proto vendoring renumbers an entry.
 *
 * @property wireNumber Wire number shared by both proto enums for this
 *   medium. Stable across the proto's history (see Quick Share's
 *   `LINT.IfChange` annotations on the enum).
