 * URL-safe base64 codec used for the mDNS TXT record key `n`.
 *
 * Quick Share TXT records carry the [EndpointInfo] bytes encoded with the
 * URL-safe alphabet (`-_` instead of `+/`) and **without** padding (`=`).
 * The reference NearDrop encoder strips the trailing `=` characters before
 * publishing the TXT record, so we mirror that behavior — both for round-trip
 * symmetry and so peers that round-trip our advertisement back to us see the
 * exact byte string they sent.
 *
 * The decoder accepts both padded and unpadded input (matching JDK
 * `Base64.getUrlDecoder()`'s lenient stance) so we interoperate with peers
 * that encode their advertisements with padding.
 *
 * Performance: the JDK's `Base64.Encoder` / `Base64.Decoder` are zero-cost
 * thread-safe singletons; we cache them as `private val` to avoid the
 * `getInstance` static lookup on every advertisement we publish.
