 *
 * Mirrors the [TransferItem] hierarchy on the inbound side -- where
 * [TransferItem] describes what the peer announced, [ReceivedItem]
 * describes what actually arrived. The two are separated because the
 * payloads do not carry the same fields:
 *
 *  - A FILE arrival exposes the [PayloadHeader] the peer sent so the
 *    higher layer (`:service-android`'s `MediaStore` writer) can use
 *    `file_name`, `total_size`, and `last_modified_timestamp_millis`
 *    to finalize the on-disk entry. We do NOT carry a `Path` or `Uri`
 *    here -- `:core-protocol` is platform-independent and the channel
 *    has already been closed by [dev.bluehouse.bada.protocol.payload.PayloadAssembler].
 *  - A BYTES arrival carries the assembled bytes directly; small
 *    enough (cap ~5 MiB) that holding them in heap is fine.
