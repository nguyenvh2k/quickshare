 * FSM or the payload encoder).
 *
 * Two frames live here:
 *
 *  - [connectionResponse] -- the **unencrypted** post-UKEY2 handshake
 *    frame the receiver sends before the SecureChannel turns on.
 *    NearDrop's `InboundNearbyConnection.swift` calls this
 *    `processConnectionResponseFrame()`; we build the equivalent here.
 *    Must emit the same six-field shape as
 *    [OutboundFrames.connectionResponse] — the validating peer does not
 *    know which role we are in, and One UI 8.0.5 validates the presence
 *    of each field unconditionally.
 *  - [disconnection] -- the post-transfer teardown frame. Sent
 *    (encrypted) right before the orchestrator closes the socket on a
 *    successful completion or rejection.
 *
 * Both helpers are pure functions; no state is held.
