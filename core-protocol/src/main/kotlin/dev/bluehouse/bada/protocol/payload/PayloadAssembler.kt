/**
 * Reassembles `PayloadTransferFrame` chunks into complete BYTES and FILE
 * payloads.
 *
 * Sits one layer above [dev.bluehouse.bada.protocol.crypto.securemessage.SecureChannel]:
 * the channel hands up decrypted, sequence-validated `OfflineFrame`s; this
 * class consumes the [PayloadTransferFrame]s nested inside
 * `OfflineFrame{type=PAYLOAD_TRANSFER}` and surfaces complete payloads via
 * [PayloadEvent].
 *
 * ### Why "reassembly" is non-trivial
 *
 * Quick Share splits each application-level payload into one or more
 * chunks of a peer-chosen size. Three properties make a naive
 * implementation wrong:
 *
 *  1. **Strict in-order BYTES, out-of-order-tolerant FILE.** Each
 *     BYTES chunk's `offset` MUST equal the cumulative byte count we
 *     have already received for that `payload_id`. BYTES payloads are
 *     small negotiation messages and reordering is meaningless for
 *     them. FILE payloads, however, may arrive in any order: this
 *     was relaxed in #44 so the receiver can survive future mediums
 *     (Wi-Fi Direct, BLE L2CAP) where the application layer cannot
 *     assume FIFO. The FILE path persists each chunk via
 *     [SeekableByteChannel.position] + write at the chunk's declared
 *     offset, and tracks coverage with a [ByteRangeSet]. Duplicate
 *     chunks (offset + body matches a fully-covered range) are
 *     deduplicated; partial overlaps that ALSO extend an existing
 *     range remain a protocol error because the wire spec does not
 *     permit them.
 *  2. **Per-payload state, not per-frame.** Multiple payloads can be
 *     "in flight" simultaneously (Android's transfer-setup phase
 *     interleaves a small BYTES negotiation payload with one or more
 *     large FILE payloads). The `payload_id` keys the buffer/file map.
 *  3. **Android's two-frame BYTES quirk.** Per `PROTOCOL.md`:
 *
 *     > Android does this thing where it sends 2 payload transfer frames
 *     > in succession for each negotiation message: the first contains
 *     > the entire message, the second contains 0 bytes but has the
 *     > `LAST_CHUNK` flag set.
 *
 *     The receiver must accept this without error. Our state machine
 *     handles it naturally: the second frame has `body.size = 0`, its
 *     `offset` equals the buffer's current length (which is the full
 *     payload), and its `LAST_CHUNK` flag triggers finalization. No
 *     special case is needed beyond *not* finalizing on `body.size ==
 *     total_size` alone — finalization MUST be gated on the LAST_CHUNK
 *     flag, not on the byte count.
 *
 * ### Threading model
 *
 * The assembler is **not thread-safe**. Quick Share connections process
 * exactly one inbound `OfflineFrame` at a time (the `SecureChannel`
 * receive coroutine holds a mutex), so all calls to [onPayloadTransfer]
 * are serialized. Adding internal locking would only slow that hot path
 * for no benefit.
 *
 * ### Send-side helpers
 *
 * [PayloadTransferEncoder] is the matching encoder for outbound BYTES
 * (and FILE) payloads, including the two-frame BYTES quirk on send.
 *
 * @param fileDestinationFactory Strategy for opening write channels for
 *   FILE payloads. Default is [TempFileDestinationFactory], suitable for
 *   tests; production wiring on Android replaces this with a factory
 *   that opens a `MediaStore` content URI.
 * @param saneFrameLength Maximum allowed `total_size` for BYTES payloads.
 *   Anything larger is rejected immediately, before any allocation, to
 *   keep a malicious peer from making us reserve hundreds of MiB of
 *   heap. 5 MiB matches Android Quick Share's negotiation message
 *   ceiling — actual file content is sent as FILE payloads, not BYTES.
 * @param resumeStateStore Optional resume-state persistence layer
 *   (#43). When non-null, the assembler:
 *     - On every successful FILE chunk write, calls
 *       [ResumeStateStore.recordCoverage] so a process crash mid-payload
 *       leaves the on-disk bytes recoverable.
 *     - On the first chunk of a FILE payload, looks up any existing
 *       coverage for `(resumeEndpointId, payloadId)` and seeds the
 *       per-payload [ByteRangeSet] from it. A peer that retransmits
 *       from offset 0 (because it does not speak AUTO_RESUME) then
 *       has every previously-received chunk silently deduplicated.
 *     - On `LAST_CHUNK` for a successfully-completed payload, calls
 *       [ResumeStateStore.forget] so the now-stale resume record is
 *       reclaimed.
 *   When null, the assembler is stateless across connections (the
 *   pre-#43 behaviour) and resume is not attempted.
 * @param resumeEndpointId The peer endpoint identifier under which to
 *   key resume records. Required for the resume-state lookups to be
 *   peer-scoped; the empty default is a sentinel that disables resume
 *   even if [resumeStateStore] is non-null. Production callers that
 *   know the peer's endpoint id pass it through; tests that don't
 *   exercise resume can leave it empty.
 * @param clock Wall-clock source for resume-record timestamps.
 *   Defaults to [System.currentTimeMillis]; tests inject a fixed lambda
 *   so the GC-window assertions are deterministic.

     *     if the cursor is not already there — in the sequential happy
     *     path the seek is elided) and writes the body.
     *  4. For duplicate chunks (every byte already covered) the body is
     *     dropped and the cursor is unchanged — the peer simply re-sent
     *     a chunk after a transient stall, which is allowed.
     *  5. For partial-overlap chunks (some bytes new, some duplicate-
     *     in-different-range) the wire is malformed and we surface a
