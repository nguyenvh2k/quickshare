/**
 * The 3-bit `deviceType` field encoded in the first byte of an [EndpointInfo]
 * descriptor.
 *
 * Values mirror PROTOCOL.md and the NearDrop Swift reference. The 3-bit field
 * has 8 possible raw values (0..7); 0..6 are documented and 7 is currently
 * undefined. Undefined raw values (including 7 and any future expansion) are
 * surfaced as [UNKNOWN] rather than throwing, so a parser running against a
 * peer that uses a newer protocol revision degrades gracefully instead of
 * dropping the entire advertisement.
 *
 * Note: the `reserved` rawValue 0 is named identically to [UNKNOWN] in the
 * canonical spec. We keep the single [UNKNOWN] entry to cover both "the peer
 * sent 0" and "the peer sent something we don't recognize".
