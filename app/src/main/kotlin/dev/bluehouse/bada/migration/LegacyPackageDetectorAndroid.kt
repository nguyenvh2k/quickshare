/**
 * Android-side wrapper around [LegacyPackageDetector] (issue #145).
 *
 * Lives in its own file — separate from the pure-data layer in
 * [LegacyPackageDetector] — so JVM unit tests in
 * `:app:testDebugUnitTest` never have to load this object. The host
 * JVM cannot verify the class because the stub `android.jar` ships
 * `android.content.pm.PackageManager$NameNotFoundException` with no
 * Code attribute on its `<init>` chain, and the Kotlin compiler emits
 * a `Class.forName` resolution for the catch clause below. Keeping
 * the catch out of the testable file is the same trick
 * [dev.bluehouse.bada.battery.BatteryOptimizationOemHelper] uses
 * for its `Intent` / `PowerManager` translation.
 *
 * Production callers (currently [dev.bluehouse.bada.MainActivity])
 * route through [findInstalledLegacy]; tests stop at
 * [LegacyPackageDetector.findLegacy] above.
