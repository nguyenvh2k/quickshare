/**
 * G2-style smooth corner treatment for ShapeableImageView /
 * MaterialShapeDrawable. Replaces the default
 * `RoundedCornerTreatment` (which renders the corner as a quarter
 * circle — G1 continuity, with a visible curvature jump where the
 * arc meets the straight edge) with a single cubic Bézier whose
 * control points are tuned so the curvature transitions smoothly
 * from zero (on the straight edges) into the corner sweep — a
 * close practical approximation of G2 continuity.
 *
 * The visual difference matters most on small radius / small
 * canvas combinations like the 12dp-corner / 64dp-square avatars
 * on the Credit screen, where the AOSP arc rendering antialiases
 * just a couple of pixels at the corner shoulder and reads as a
 * "clumped" corner. The cubic ramp distributes that transition
 * across more pixels, giving the antialiaser more room to work
 * and producing a noticeably softer corner.
 *
 * The Bézier control-point factor [SHOULDER_FACTOR] is the knob
 * that trades "circle-like" (≈ 0.55) vs "squircle-like" (lower
 * values, sharper shoulder transitions). 0.45 is the iOS-icon-ish
 * sweet spot — visibly different from a pure circle, still reads
 * as a "rounded corner" rather than a pinched custom shape.
