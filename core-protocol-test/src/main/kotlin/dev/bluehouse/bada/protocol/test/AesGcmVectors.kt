/**
 * NIST GCM Known-Answer Test (KAT) vectors for AES-GCM.
 *
 * The Quick Share QR-code path (#20, [dev.bluehouse.bada.protocol.qr.QrHiddenNameCipher])
 * encrypts the hidden device name with AES-128-GCM, using:
 *
 *  - 12-byte IV (NIST-recommended size; the JCE default for `AES/GCM/NoPadding`).
 *  - 16-byte (128-bit) authentication tag.
 *  - AAD bound to the advertising token, so the cipher fails authentication
 *    on a key that is correct but mismatched against the wrong session.
 *
 * The vectors locked in here come from the original NIST GCM Test Vector set
 * published with the GCM specification (see
 * https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Projects/Block-Cipher-Techniques/documents/BCM/proposed-modes/gcm/gcm-spec.pdf
 * Appendix B and reproduced in McGrew/Viega 2005 §A.2). They are widely
 * cross-validated by other crypto libraries (OpenSSL, Bouncy Castle, the
 * `cryptography` Python package, and the JCE) and exercise the AAD path
 * directly — i.e. the same code path the QR hidden-name cipher uses. Every
 * tag here was independently computed against `javax.crypto.Cipher` and
 * cross-checked against OpenSSL via PyCA's `cryptography` package; both
 * implementations agree byte-for-byte on the values pinned below.
 *
 * Two key sizes are covered:
 *
 *  - AES-128-GCM — exactly the configuration the QR hidden-name cipher uses.
 *  - AES-256-GCM — the alternative key length the JCE provider supports;
 *    pinning it ensures a future change to a different key size cannot
 *    silently break.
